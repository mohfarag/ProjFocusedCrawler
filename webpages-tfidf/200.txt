Charlottsville police pleaded in a new press conference for anyone who saw a 6’2″ black male with the pretty University of Virgina student to come forward. He was the last person to be seen with Hannah, before she disappeared Sept. 13.
Hannah Graham, 18, is still missing, but police, specifically Chief Timothy Longo, revealed surprising new findings during a press conference on Sept. 19. They are also currently looking for information about a man, who they believe was in a bar with Hannah the night she disappeared.

Heather Graham Press Conference — Police Looking For ‘Person Of Interest’
This person has been described as a 6’2″ black male with dreadlocks, who weighs about 270 pounds. While police are calling him a “person of interest,” they do not have enough information to arrest him.

Authorities believe this man accompanied Hannah into a bar along the city’s downtown mall and purchased alcohol shortly after 1 A.M. ET Saturday morning, Sept. 13, after the sophomore was seen on video walking alone.
Police said they know the two were in the bar together, and they know the black male drove away from the area in a 1998 burnt orange Chrysler coupe.
Unfortunately, Timothy said, while police know this man’s name and have searched his car and apartment, they do not have the legal authority to arrest him.

“People saw Hannah and people saw him and people saw them together,” Timothy during the news conference. “It is possible Hannah Graham may have gotten into his vehicle, a vehicle we seized. … We have every reason to believe she was in that car.”
Police believe this information is a major break in the case. Yet, Hannah is still missing and no one is in custody. Timothy said he is hopeful the new information will lead to an arrest in the case.
“My gut tells me there’s more video,” Timothy added.
Hannah Graham: Candlelight Vigil — Thousands Gather For Student Who Vanished
Following Hannah’s Sept. 13 disappearance, students, family members and loved ones gathered on Sept. 18 for a vigil in honor of the missing student. While holding candles and playing music in the University of Virginia Amphitheater, all who attended shared their wish for Hannah’s safe return home.
Hannah Graham Parents Go Public — Make Emotional TV Plea For Her To Return Home
Earlier this week, police released surveillance videos from night Hannah disappeared. Based on these videos, the second year student was last seen in the early hours of Sept. 13, walking throughout sections of Charlottesville, Virginia. Hannah was briefly followed by an unidentified man, but that gentleman, who has since been identified, claims that the University of Virginia student walked away with another unidentified man, who does not exactly match, but has similar characteristics to this new “person of interest.”
Our thoughts go out to Hannah’s family and friends during this difficult time. We are hoping for Hannah’s safe return.

Sad that the author of this article “Christopher Rodgers” can’t even get her first name correct. Another useless fool reporting or bad editing. Take your pick.

So very sad she did not know  not dress  with exposed body parts, walk alone at night or talk to strangers, letnmg.  Noone helped her with her eyebrows either and no freind came to her rescue when she texted she was was lost.  sad all around.

Apparently no one taught the man who abducted her not to take advantage of women.  THAT is sad.

A good and planned irrigation system can save a geeat deal of money and electricity bills for you.
The lawn mower blades made by known brands like Scotts, MTD,
John Dee lwn or Toro usually only last abnout a year.
Many of these lawn care strategies are designed too help improve your lawn’s
resistance to winter diseases.
