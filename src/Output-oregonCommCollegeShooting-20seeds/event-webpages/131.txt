A witness said the shooting happened in Professor Larry Levine’s class:

4. He Wrote On His Blog ‘Seems the More People You Kill, the More You’re in the Limelight’


(Kickass Torrents)


Harper Mercer 
and also often uploaded to the file-sharing website. One of his last uploads was a documentary about the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting:






Chris Harper Mercer uploaded 'This World Surviving Sandy Hook BBC Documentary 2015'… 3 days ago.


 


— Vanguard 14 (@keksec_org) 




On the blog,
, the disgruntled former TV reporter who killed a reporter and cameraman in Virginia in August.


“On an interesting note, I have noticed that so many people like him are all alone and unknown, yet when they spill a little blood, the whole world knows who they are. A man who was known by no one, is now known by everyone. His face splashed across every screen, his name across the lips of every person on the planet, all in the course of one day. Seems the more people you kill, the more your’re in the limelight,” he wrote.


He also wrote about the shooting of a police officer in Houston, Texas, saying “This whole event seems similar to the one in new york earlier this year where that guy killed those two cops sitting in a parked car. The inflammatory rhetoric on both sides, whether warranted or not will only continue to agitate the situation and events such as these will happen more and more. These are just my thoughts on the matter. Will continue to post more blogs on related subjects, as well any interesting thoughts I may have.”


(Kickass Torrents)


He added, “In case anyone’s wondering, I’m not on the side of the suspect, I’m on the side of the officer, and generally don’t agree with the black lives matter protests.”


In another post, titled, “The material world is a lie,” 


The material world is a lie. For so long we have been taught that what’s important in life is to buy this and have that. To always have the latest fashion, biggest tv, fanciest car, nicest house, and blah,blah, blah. Well, the truth is we’ve become so attached to these things, our spiritual development has been halted. Just like they say in fight club “We become owned by the things we own”. Most people will spend hours standing in front of stores just to buy a new iphone. Those same people will complain about how they don’t have enough money but will always have money to spend on apple products. This attachment produces so much of the stress and worrying in the world today. I used to be like that, always concerned about what clothes I had, rather than whether or not I was happy. But not anymore. Since then I have learned the truth that such attachments are falsehoods and will only bring misery.This is my first blog post, there will be more to come.


He also posted on the website that he has never had a girlfriend.


The blog matches his email address, ironcross45@gmail.com, which he used on his dating profiles.


A blog post allegedly written by reported Umpqua Community College gunman Chris Mercer Harper seems to idolize Vester Flanagan, the man who killed 2 WDBJ7 TV reporters on-camera.




5. The Internet Tore Apart an Innocent 4Chan Poster Whose Name & YouTube Videos Were Tied to the Shooting


(Google Maps)


Before the actual name of the shooter was released, a different name, Toby Reynolds, also known as Egg Man, spread on social media and some websites as the shooter.


He 
 and told them he was alive and not the shooter.


YouTube videos he posted spread quickly across the internet.


A
 Wednesday night at 7:19 p.m. local time that said “Some of you guys are alright. Don’t go to school tomorrow if you live in the northwest,” is being investigated as possibly connected to the shooting.


In the discussion thread, some users told him not to do it, while others encouraged him and gave him ideas for how he could kill people.


One person responded saying, “I suggest you enter a classroom and tell people that you will take them as hostages. Make everyone get in one corner and then open fire. Make sure that there is no way that someone can disarm you as it it possible. I suggest you carry a knife on your belt as last resort if someone is holding your gun.”


Another poster said, “You might want to target a girls school which is safer because there are no beta males throwing themselves for their rescue. Do not use a shotgun. I would suggest a powerful assault rifle and a pistol or 2x pistols. Possibly the type of pistols who have 15+ ammo.”


It’s not clear if the 4 Chan posts were connected to the actual shooter, Chris Harper Mercer.

Chris Harper Mercer is the alleged gunman who killed 10 at Umpqua Community College. But did he say he was going to on a shooting spree on 4Chan the night before?

you are the actual problem……you, don’t want to mentally ill to be reported so they are allowed to get gun. Tucson, Aurora, Chapel Hill the same thing. Mentally ill  people are not reported and they get guns. Sandy Hook was exactly the same…..a nut gets his hands on gun and his mother allowed it. He killed her first, he was at the school the day before causing problems there and no one calls the police. He kills all those innocent children because no,one did their job or told a soul! I have been around a lot longer and seen this over and over. Over 20 killed by 2 wackos in Ukraine with a hammer and A piece of pipe. So it’s not just guns at all…….it’s the apathetic people here that think they won’t do a thing to stop a wacko. Right…..just look around and you will see it happen. Criminals have more rights than the victims now.  What?

Not Better just More!  Yes they have tracked them to one murder after another. So did try to tell me you know this at all……you have no idea! Yes there have been hundreds killed with Obama guns now here and in Mexico. So who would be the accessory to every single one of them?  You might just try to read a bit and get a few facts about this and not just blame Bush…..you sound just like Obama now!

The U.S. is the largest import vector for illegal firearms to the cartels in Mexico – and it’s because there aren’t universal background checks. The gun show loophole and resale loophole allow traffickers to move large volumes of otherwise unobtainable guns with little to no threat of persecution.


So you might rethink your line.

Several years ago they stop a yacht heading into Mexico……it made contact with a ship at sea. It was loaded with a few hundred AK-47s and hand grenades for the cartel……did hear much about that did you? It was in the news……very very quietly! Not here though! Only in Mexico!!

All i know is that he was not a Muslim, and if he claimed to be one then he still wasnt as we are peaceful people…But in his fleeting moments, if he did claim to be part of the UMMAH I ask that he Repented from any shirk/kufr that he had done by giving into evil which is foreign to ISLAM, maybe he said it out loud and cried over his wrongdoings and then said the shahadah [أشهد أن لا إله إلاَّ الله و أشهد أن محمد رسول الله; “””There is no god but Allah and Muhammad is the messenger of Allah.”” Of course Allah is most wise, most merciful. If you we ALL TRUST in almighty Allah he will redeem him and ALL OF US for he is most generous. . Believe it in your heart and pronounce it on your tongue. “Say O my servants who have transgressed against their souls! Despair not of the mercy of Allah, for Allah forgives all sins, for he is oft forgiving, Most merciful.” (Az Zumar 39:53)

Yeah, tell that to the Islamist elsewhere in the world.  The spirit of anti-Christ inhabits many.  What this man did is bad.  If Muhammad is the messenger of Allah, then the message from Muhammad to this man is…”You did alright…you killed and wounded many infidels today …Peace be unto you in the name of Allah, the merciful(?) one.   There is no more true representative of Satan than Allah and his messenger of death and example of killing infidels is Muhammad.  Peace be unto his cursed name?  Satan is a liar…so is Muhammad, and so are you.

Very true! In fact their beloved Mahdi (whom they are waiting for, like we wait for Jesus to return) is very much expected to be THE Christian Anti-Christ by many Christians and Apologetics professionals… I am very much an End Times enthusiast, and the way things are lining up according to what is written in the Bible – I just don’t see how it can be very far off. Especially with the way the entire WORLD is turning against Israel. God will NEVER allow Israel to be destroyed, so when things start getting out of hand there, everyone had better be making peace with their Maker and Jesus Christ – because it won’t be long before God’s wrath will come down!

Ahmed, I’m interested, its normal to defend your religion when it is used as an excuse to commit atrocities in the name of your God. However, it does state in the Koran that it is permissible to kill infidels, to rape slave woman, amongst other things that are unacceptable in modern times. Just like the Bible, is not the Koran open to the interpretation  of the individual?

GOD is fined by all and weather your a muslim, christian, Buddhist, or what ever you belief, We all agree on there being one GOD!  There will never be just one religion and all people have diversity of religion, One thing I have learned is to accept all people, all religions and do not judge any, for this is the greater sprit that GOD gives upon to you..is that the peace he gives to you is the peace he leaves to us all!!!!  I accept all religions that help people and their sprit to fill fulfilled and i have been in the middle east and the USA.  Open all your hearts to the human race as one,,, GOD does not choose one person to be greater than himself but only he is the one and only in all religions.!

I just did that, and it is a little disturbing to see that the male friend seems to be into ISIS… Could this have been a lone wolf terror attack on our own soil, that was brought on by the social media connection of a very disturbed young man and a very manipulative, conniving Islamic terrorist? The questions about his victim’s religion do tie into that hypothesis, that’s for sure! Either way, none of us will ever hear the TRUTH about it, if that is the case with this POTUS! He always makes sure to coddle those Muslims, no matter what they do – but he has little sympathy for mainstream Christian victims, LEOs or the men and women who give up their lives for HIM and HIS country!!!

We need to stop writing people off as nutjobs. These people  are not mentally I’ll . This was a premeditated  murder. His intent was to go and kill people at a school. It also seems like he was part of a Sub culture that was introverted and into guns and murdering zombies. The introverts are beta males  socially  awkward. These are the profiles of  would be mass murder college shooters. Would be much easier to take care of these mother fuckers  if people were allowed to have guns on school campus. Someone would of merc his ass before he can pull off one shot. Police are limited in supply if you got them on campus then there not somewhere else. For those that want to make this a political issue and think more gun control will fixed this sorry.  No guns mean they come in on the black market just like illegal drugs just that government can no longer regulate it. We need more guns in public spaces. More conceal. Carry users. If there was a gun in every bush. A gunman thinking to commit a crime will think three times before he attempted it

Things like this will continue to happen if America does not turn back to God and put the Bible back  in Schools.  This guys was out of his mind and should have been on the College Radar.  Why was he not on the Police Radar?  Anyway, we PRAY FOR THE VICTOMS FAMILIES and for the State of Oregon.


Thank you first responders for taking the lead!  And yes, the 1st Amendment rights are NOT to those who encouraged.  They committed a Terrorist act as well.The FBI SHOULD AND COULD ARREST THEM ASAP!  CHARGE:  Conspiracy to commit murder.  ATF AND FBI take the lead on this one!

The man is from a blue state and claimed to be a republican/ conservative which is a joke because conservatives are not violent people. Liberals live in a world where everything is okay, destroying towns like Ferguson, biting off fingers, babies out of wedlock, abortion after abortion, same sex marrying same sex so it does not surprise me that this man from a blue state was out of control!!?

There it is again… Generalization of “liberals, Blue states, etc” just as there are MANY “levels” of conservative, right wing “Christians”, there are many of us in Oregon and abroad, who have belief in God, following the Catholic/Cristian ways, but also truly care about the Human population around the world. I despise what this man did, and many other have done. The problem is, that with most mass shootings, especially in this country, are NOT religion based. (There are those too) it just seems way to common and way to easy for the “right wing, conservatives” to blame liberals…. When that is your ONLY argument, it’s hard to believe that many of those people can see the actual bigger picture into what’s happening in this country. I find it disappointing, that no rational, helpful discussions and solutions can come from the people here in the UNITED states of America. So easy to point fingers, and rabidly blame liberals or conservatives, instead of working together to end this kind of thing in America…. One can hope that someday people here will learn of working together and learning to compromise for the better good of all of us.

What religion were the victims? The article points out that the shooter asked about religion before he started shooting, but the author seemed to forget to complete the thought.

Religious beliefs should be private. If it’s a honest belief, it’s between you and God or you or you and a Higher Power or you and whatever language you are comfortable with to represent a divine presence.  There should be no need to impose one’s faith belief or faith on another unless that need is expressed by someone who lacks faith, belief and feels the need. That is all. Murder is murder. Those who kill others in the name of religion are disqualified from the rights and freedoms available to others. I am not saying guns are the problem but they sure make their presence known in nearly all of these senseless, collective tragedies where the hopes and dreams of all these innocent people and their families and friends are gone forever in an instant.What ever happened to the America we used to think we knew?.

If that really is his MySpace page, then he was an IRA (Irish Republican Army) supporter and identified himself as Irish Republican. There is a very, very big difference between them and the U.S. Republicans. Try doing some research before making it a headline you hack!

“I have a pill bottle with like five types of pills mixed in. I don’t know which ones are the sleep aids, so I just took four of each” – Chris Harper Mercer August 16th post.  Go figure, he was on drugs or proscribed psychotropics or anti depressants.

For those of you lucky  enough  to not live in Oregon,  you have no idea how extremely racist  Oregon it is.  


This is our second school shooting within two years.  The last one was at a highschool and the shooter supported Nazism. Before the shooting he did report at school about Nazism then got angry when people  disagreed with his views. 


And after,  the terrible,  unholy, ungodly, church shooting in Charleston, most of the commenters in the local state paper, the Oregonian,  said the shooter was justified or something along those lines.  There was very little condemning of the shooting and a lot of support for it,  bizarrely enough. The main public radio station for the state,  OPB,  did not do any coverage of the Charleston shooting, except for some scant,  brief,  article several days after the shooting.  


The Oregonian comments also have expressed strong support for the acceptance of slavery, including some Oregonian reporters/writers.  But what it is constantly in the comment section is blame for any and every problem on Latinos. 


Racism,  white supremacy and the support of Nazism is so common place it’s actually unusual to see anyone take the opposite view.  


Most of the police in the Portland and suburban area shave their head to show their support of Nazism . As far as I know, hair style  is not against the law.  But it is quite unusual to see so many  people with a uniform bald head. 


Oregon has a long history of the Klu Klux Klan.  They tried to keep  black people out of the state when it first became a state.  Then later the KKK tried to close down Catholic Schools.  So you see white supremacy,  Nazism  and the KKK have a long history and a lot of support,  acceptance and approval in Oregon. 


I swear Portland is even more divided by race than Ferguson.  There are so many white only restaurants and businesses , you’d have  to be blind not to notice how segregated it is.  


Living here is very difficult,  dangerous,  extremely unfriendly and yes,  quite violent being a Latina woman.  There is total and complete hegemony about race.

I’d gladly move but you see I have several injuries and serious health conditions all due from racial attacks.  See they say move but they don’t want you to.  They simply  want a human punching bag.  In the short and brief periods I’m not suffering from injuries by total and complete strangers I work as hard as possible on starting an online tech company. Without injuries I’d have been out of here a long time ago.

You’re nuts. If its that bad, up in Portland… Why do you choose to live there. I’m in Southern Oregon, an hour away from the shooting. Oregon is beautiful, has great people. Was and still is hit hard by the economy(Southern Oregon worse off then anywhere in the state). I have lived in St. Louis, but am a born and raised 5th generation Oregonian, with quite a few Latino friends as well as co-workers, and I will say, neither is more or less racist. I’ve also lived in Seattle/Tacoma and have seen racism, no more or less than Oregon. By the way, I shave my head, does that make me a Nazi sympathizer? If you don’t like it here in Oregon….leave. Sorry for your twisted opinion of our state.

Andrew, youve got to learn how to type/write /correctly write a sentence. Dont post crap that makes you look illiterate! 


This Chris character obviously wasnt happy with this life at all. Very angry at the world & his surroundings. What this all comes down to is EVIL. Theres no God involved in this tragedy let alone in the shooters life. It sounds & looks like to me that he NEEDED a lot of organized religion & GOD in his life. He surely wasnt happy with what he didnt have……GOD in his life.

Lets keep the ones that were murdered & their families’ in our thoughts & prayers; pray that he goes directly to hell!! Maybe there he’ll be happier!!

The answer is bear arms and another thing.. this is a mentally ill person; because he was not subjected to any more influences in the world than anyone else; his brain was not filtering information correctly i.e. he was devoid of whatever it is that keeps a person right in their thinking. People like that are a danger to society.

Its 4chan. People who say stuff about the couragement and how they should be punished. I like to say you are ignorant. I am an active user on 4chan and this happens everday. Remember why 4chan is so hated? Not one person on 4chan believed him nor took him serious. We joke about these all the time and which, 4chan jokes about every tragedy. Get a grip and blame the shooter not anyone else. The shooters never get blamed. Its always their religion race bullies revenge and never themselves.

Here is your proof!!! I want you guys to look up the “shooter” Chris Harper Mercer on his Myspace page, and then look who he has a connection to. There are only two people on that page that he is connected to. Click on Mahmoud Ali Ehsani which is Chris Harper Mercer’s buddy…. look at the photos as they scroll…. tell me that this isn’t a terrorist act rather then lobbying for gun control!!!! There is a muslim guy with ISIS pictures on there! And this Chris Harper Mercer guy has a direct “connection” to him on MySpace!!!! This isn’t about gun control!! This is a ISIS attack on our soil!!! No wonder they took so long to release this guys name!!! Do the research people, PLEASE!!!!!!!!!!!

Now tell me how many of his friends and family knew this guy was mentally ill. I will bet if he was living at home like he say here, his parents or parent knew this and did nothing! This is the same thing over and over, no one does a thing. Everyone of these mass shooting is the same. I mentally ill person get’s guns that they shouldn’t have because no one reports them at all. Go look at every one of them. The same!!
