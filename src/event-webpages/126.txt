(CNN) -- One of the worst-hit cities in the Philippines, Tacloban, has been completely devastated by Typhoon Haiyan. The capital city of Leyte province, nearly 400 miles south-east of Manila, was one of the first places hit by the storm.
Around 200,000 people were made homeless in a matter of hours as a wall of ocean water flattened their houses.
Tacloban City Stadium was one of just a handful of structures in the area to withstand the storm, despite its coastal location.
It is now being used as a refugee center where thousands of people have taken shelter.
Scroll the slider above to see the stadium before and after the storm.
CNN's Ivan Watson toured the typhoon-devastated Tacloban region by air, read his personal account of the destruction he saw.
