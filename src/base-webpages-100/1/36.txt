Crisis in South Sudan 

Nearly 4 million people remain in urgent need in South Sudan following the conflict that broke out in December 2013. Over 1.9 million people have fled their homes and are displaced within the country and over 479,000 have fled to neighboring countries. We have reached more than 360,000 people with life saving essentials, but we urgently need to reach more.  





 

Crisis in Syria 

More than three years after the beginning of the conflict in Syria the war shows no sign of abating. Massive numbers of refugees have fled conflict areas and are now living in inadequate shelter within Syria or in neighboring countries.

Oxfam monitoring Typhoon Hagupit threat in PhilippinesPublished: 4 December 2014 



Oxfam has contingency stocks positioned throughout the Philippines and has staff ready to support in an emergency response.


Justin Morgan
Oxfam Country Director in the Philippines 



Oxfam is closely watching Typhoon Hagupit and has contingency stocks and staff on standby, as the Philippines prepares for the storm to make landfall this weekend.While the path of the cyclone could divert, the Philippines Government and humanitarian organisations are working together to reduce risk to life and property.Speaking from Tacloban last night, Oxfam Country Director in the Philippines Justin Morgan said preparations were already under way.“We are watching Typhoon Hagupit closely,” Morgan said.“Local Government Units are activating their evacuation plans, in coordination with other humanitarian agencies. Oxfam has contingency stocks positioned throughout the Philippines and has staff ready to support in an emergency response.“One year on from Typhoon Haiyan, the Philippines has improved its preparedness. People are much more aware of which locations are safe and what provisions they should stock.  However, the fear is that not all evacuation centres have been fully repaired.”Contact informationAngus Hohenboken, Media officerT. +61 392899246 Mob: +61 428367318 / angush@oxfam.org.au
