19Apr2011 			Jason on Riz Khan with Dirk Vandewalle		
For my first live TV appearance, I was a Featured Guest on Al-Jazeera English’s Riz Khan Show  alongside Dirk Vandewalle. We discussed the African Union’s peace plan and a I gave a cogent defense of the importance of a distinction between the rebel’s political leadership and the revolutionary fighters.  This appears prescient as it is precisely this distinction which became the central dynamic in post-Qadhafian Libyan politics.


05Apr2011 			The Two Faces of Libya’s Rebels		
From Foreign Policy, Pack’s —  The Two Faces of Libya’s Rebels: The anti-Qaddafi forces are a strange mix of ragtag fighters and defector technocrats. And more than guns, the latter desperately need Western moral support.
If you let strangers know that you research Libya for a living, there seems to be only one question on their minds: “Who are the Libyan rebels?” I’ve been asked it at cocktail parties, on ski lifts, at academic seminars, and even by Western journalists in Benghazi who have developed the flattering habit of Skype-ing me at odd hours. Americans seem captivated by this question, perhaps because they have heard senior U.S. officials from Defense Secretary Robert Gates to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to various Republican congressmen proclaim that they do not yet know enough about who the rebels are. I do not take such statements at face value. U.S. statesmen know quite well who the rebels are — but pretend otherwise to obscure the fact that the United States has yet to formulate a comprehensive policy toward them.
The rebels consist of two distinct groups: the fighters and the political leadership.
