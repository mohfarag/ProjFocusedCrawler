Dylann Roof, who gunned down nine people in a prayer meeting, has been captured by police.
The 21-year-old from Lexington, South Carolina, has been arrested after an intense manhunt by officers.
Dylann Roof was identified by his own uncle Carson Cowels, 56, who recognised him on CCTV footage released by police.
Cowels said his nephew had received a gun for his birthday in April. It’s not yet known if the .45 calibre pistol was the gun used in the attack.

Nine people – six women and three men were killed in the attack at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church, which has strong historical links to the black community.
Church pastor Clementa Pinckney was among the victims, as was Cynthia Hurd, 54; Tywanza Sanders, 26; Sharonda Singleton, 45; Myra Thompson, 59; Ethel Lance, 70; Susie Jackson, 87; the Rev. Daniel Simmons Sr., 74; and DePayne Doctor, 49.
Before opening fire on the church congregation, Roof is thought to have said: ‘You rape our women and you’re taking over our country’.
The shooting are being investigated as a hate crime.

Greg Mullen confirmed the arrest during a press conference. The Charleston Police Chief said: ‘This case could not have been cleared at quickly as it has been if not for all the investigation involved in the operation. I can’t say how grateful I am. Some of them have worked tirelessly.’
Mayor Joseph P Riley added: ‘We’ve had extraordinary cooperation. Because of all of that work, we can announce that that awful person – the terrible human being who went into a place of worship when they were playing would kill them – is in custody.’
Roof has been arrested twice previously a drugs charge and another for trespassing. It’s thought that he acted alone.

CHICAGO (CBS) —
 Two people were injured Wednesday morning, when their car crashed and flipped over as they were fleeing police officers who fired shots when the suspects allegedly tried to run them over.


Police a 911 call came in around 10:30 a.m. regarding a suspicious vehicle in an alley near 79th Street and Saginaw Avenue around 10:30 a.m.


Fraternal Order of Police spokesman Pat Camden said a uniformed police officer was in her squad car nearby at 79th and Exchange Avenue, when she spotted a red Ford Mustang matching the description from the 911 call. 


“Gets out of her car with weapon in hand, orders the occupants in the vehicle to get out. Instead of getting out, they throw the car in reverse, and they’re heading right at her. She fires a couple of shots at the car, hitting the car at that point, we believe,” Camden said.


According to Camden, there was a train coming at the time, and the officer had nowhere to go when the suspects tried to run her over, so she shot at them to protect herself. After she shot at the suspects, they fled west on 79th Street, Camden said.


“There’s another squad car that starts chasing the red Mustang. At about 79th and Constance, the offenders hit another vehicle, lose control of their vehicle, the Mustang flips over, both offenders in the car are injured,” Camden said.


A police spokesperson said the suspects were taken to hospitals with non-life-threatening injuries. Neither was struck by the officer’s gunfire.
