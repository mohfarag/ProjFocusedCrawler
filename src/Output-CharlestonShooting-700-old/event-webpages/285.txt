Victim identified after fatal shooting in Lafayette


 


LAFAYETTE (April 21, 2015) – A man died Tuesday after a shooting that prompted a lockdown at Lafayette-area schools.
The shooting happened around 11:30 a.m. in the 900 block of North 9th Street. According to Lafayette police, Wesley C. Ehrie, 32, was taken to St. Elizabeth East Hospital where he died from his wounds.
According to police, there was a dispute over some personal property that led up to the shooting. Ehrie knew his shooter. Several schools remained on lockdown through 1:30 p.m.
More than a dozen Lafayette police officers responded along with investigators from Purdue University police.
Anyone with information about this investigation is asked to call the Lafayette Police Department at (765) 807-1200.
