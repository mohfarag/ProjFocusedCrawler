Salt Lake police looking for suspect in attempted child abduction


 


SALT LAKE CITY — Salt Lake City police are looking for a man who reportedly tried to abduct a 12-year-old boy Monday afternoon.
According to a report from SLCPD, the boy was riding his bike at Poplar Grove Park, near 800 S Emery Street, when he stopped to use a water fountain.
At that point, the report said, the suspect approached the boy from behind and attempted to grab him.
The victim then shoved the suspect, rode his bike home and called police.
Police attempted to locate the suspect, but were unsuccessful.
The suspect was described as a tall, white male, bald, with a lot of wrinkles. He was wearing a blue shirt and black shorts, the report said.
Anyone with information that may help police locate the suspect is urged to call (801) 799-3000 or send an anonymous tip via text message.
To remain anonymous, send a text message to 274637. Start the text with the keyword TIPSLCPD (which routes it to SLCPD), then a space, followed by the relevant information or photos.

Find him, skin him alive, and slowly dip him in battery acid.  On TV.  Live.
That WILL cut down on child abductions.  I guarantee it.
