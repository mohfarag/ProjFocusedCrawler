The person above is NOT the suspect.  His name is Austin Rich, he was just wearing a similar looking outfit as the suspect.  He was questioned and released.  


So the guy that was taken in handcuffs was NOT the suspect. It was a local cameraman. #chsnews

This is a tragedy! I’ve never understood the motivation behind all these wackos that feel the need to get some notoriety by killing others.

And “his” name has been spelled three different ways that I’ve seen so far: Dylan, Dyllan, and this (most interesting) Dylann.  ANN?  He does look very effeminate. The small ankle in the large boots, and then the alleged comment about women being raped …
