Burger meal: Cops bought killer Dylann Roof a Burger King meal











Racist gunman Dylann Roof was given a Burger King meal by police after he shot dead nine churchgoers. The confessed killer told officers who seized him after 14 hours on the run he was hungry and had not eaten since before the attack.  Police chief Jeff Ledford said they bought him food from a nearby Burger King .  “He was very quiet, very calm. He didn’t talk,” Ledford said. “He sat very quietly.”  Hours after shooting nine churchgoers dead, racist gunman Dylann Roof was treated to a Burger King meal by police.  The confessed killer complained of being hungry following his arrest after carrying out his massacre at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, South Carolina last Wednesday.

 After the shooting he fled in his black Hyundai car 250 miles north where he was finally apprehended in Shelby after 14 hours on the run. Now the police chief whose officers arrested Roof has revealed cops bought him a Burger King meal after he said he hadn’t eaten since carrying out the assault. Jeff Ledford said the killer refused to answer any question put to him by his staff and that the only conversation he had was about food. Ledford said police bought him food from a nearby Burger King. “He was very quiet, very calm. He didn’t talk,” Ledford said. “He sat down here very quietly. He was not problematic.” Roof had been found with .45-calibre handgun in his car and told armed police “I am Dylann Roof” when he was arrested. He is reported to have shown no remorse and expressed racist views as he later confessed to the crime to the FBI.

If found guilty prosecutors as well as South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley have said they will seek the death penalty.   It comes as the relatives Roof’s victim told him during his first court appearance on Friday they forgave him for the killings.  Many have said they would not want him sent to the death chamber.

Sources at the Sheriff Al Cannon Detention Centre have said the two killers can talk to each other through shouting but both have refused. “Roof is sitting quietly in his cell and not saying a word,” said the insider. “The only person he has conversed with is his lawyer. “It seems everyone else has washed their hands of him. “He remains on suicide watch.”
