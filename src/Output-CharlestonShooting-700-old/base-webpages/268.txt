QUEENS — Dozens came together in Queens Saturday to pray for the victims of the Charleston Emanuel AME Church shooting. Mourners sang “We Shall Overcome” and marched arm-in-arm.Mayor Bill de Blasio and Allen AME Church leaders were among those leading the rally.”Light overcomes hate and love always chases away darkness,” said one parishioner of Allen AME.Attendees lit nine candles for each of the nine victims in Wednesday’s attack. 21-year-old Dylann Roof has been charged with their murders. He allegedly yelled racist slurs before he opened fire.
“Yes, it was terrorism,” said Mayor de Blasio, “terrorism based on racism. But that does not negate the fact that we have a gun problem in this country.”
People at the rally also cheered when some called for South Carolina to lower the confederate flag. It currently flies outside the state house.
Emanuel AME in Charleston South Carolina is expected to re-open tomorrow for Sunday services.
