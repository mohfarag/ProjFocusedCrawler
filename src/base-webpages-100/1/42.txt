PHOTOS: Hagupit Causes Loss of Life, Destruction in Philippines

Former Super Typhoon Hagupit, locally known as Ruby, impacted more than 30 million people across the Philippines with heavy rain and strong winds from Saturday into Tuesday.
Before landfall in the Philippines, Hagupit strengthened into a super typhoon with sustained winds near 290 kph (180 mph), the equivalent to a Category 5 hurricane in the Atlantic or Eastern Pacific Ocean. While the storm did weaken prior to landfall, it has remained a very dangerous cyclone as it crossed the Philippines over several days.
At least 25 people died due to the former super typhoon, according to the Philippine Red Cross.

Updates from the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (NDRRMC) stated that more than 1.6 million people were being served inside and outside of evacuation centers.
Hagupit made landfall in the province of Eastern Samar, just north of where Haiyan made landfall last year. Since landfall, Hagupit has continued on a weakening trend as it moved west of the Philippines into the South China Sea.

With landfall farther north, the areas hardest-hit by Haiyan escaped the worst tidal surge from Hagupit but were still impacted by heavy rainfall; this includes the city of Tacloban which was devastated by Haiyan. Many other areas are still trying to recover from Haiyan, which left them more vulnerable to the impacts of Hagupit.
Hagupit is long gone from the Philippines which is good news. However, it will be several days or weeks before some areas are able to recover from the recent damages.

Rainfall has already produced dramatic flooding along the path of Hagupit with 150-300 mm (6-12 inches) falling across much of Visayas as well as southern and eastern Luzon and Mindoro.
As of Sunday evening, local time, rainfall had surpassed 400 mm (16 inches) in Borongan and 350 mm (14 inches) in Catbalogan. Both cities are located on Samar Island where Hagupit made landfall.
Despite passing south of Manila, the city still experienced bands of heavy rainfall and gusty winds. The heaviest rain passed just south of Metro Manila where more then 150 mm (6 inches) fell on Monday. Rainfall across the city itself averaged 25-50 mm (1-2 inches).
Areas along the direct path of Hagupit experienced widespread flooding and mudslides. Widespread power outages were reported in these along with some impassable roadways due to the flooding and mudslides which could leave some villages cut off from outside aid for several days.

Areas hardest hit could be without electricity for a week or longer.
Hagupit is also responsible for hundreds of sea vessels being stranded in ports, while several hundred flights were cancelled from various airports across the Philippines, according to the Philippine National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council.
It was also reported that more than 47,000 homes have been damaged or destroyed by Hagupit.
