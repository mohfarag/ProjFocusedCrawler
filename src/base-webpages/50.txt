The federal government has accounted for more Australians listed as missing after the Nepal earthquake, and is offering flights out of the country to survivors.
The foreign affairs minister, Julie Bishop, said 1,150 people had now been contacted, up from about 830 on Monday, and they were “safe and well”.
Melbourne woman Renu Fotedar died after an avalanche at the Mount Everest base camp on Sunday caused by a 6.7 magnitude aftershock.

“Her family are in Kathmandu and our embassy are providing consular assistance to them,” Bishop told Nine Network on Tuesday. Bishop extended her condolences to the friends and family of Fotedar.
“We will continue to search for any Australians who are unaccounted for but I’m pleased to confirm that 1,150 have been accounted for,” she said.
Australia is sending more humanitarian supplies and personnel to Nepal, where more than 4,000 people are confirmed dead and more than 6,500 injured.
But the opposition said Australia should be contributing more. Labor’s foreign affairs spokeswoman, Tanya Plibersek, said the $5m the federal government had allocated for humanitarian assistance so far was “pretty modest”.
“I certainly think we could do more,” she told ABC TV.
The government is advising Australians in Nepal who cannot get a commercial flight home to contact the Australian embassy there.
“We will have an air force plane taking humanitarian supplies over and so it can take Australians to Bangkok where they can get a commercial flight home if they are unable to get out of Nepal,” Bishop said.
