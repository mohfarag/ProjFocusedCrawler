Taylor Swift pays tribute to Charleston victims







Taylor Swift has shared her sadness at the tragic shooting that took place inside a Charleston church last night. The singer took to Twitter to express her shock and reaction to the sad news as nine people were killed in the horrific church attack. “Plane landed, turned on my phone, and my heart dropped to the floor. Charleston… This is an unbearable loss of lives and innocence," she tweeted after hearing the news.  Plane landed, turned on my phone, and my heart dropped to the floor.

Dylann Roof, 21, was named by the FBI this afternoon as the suspect behind the shootings inside a Charleston church last night. FBI agents flooded his neighbourhood as they desperately tried to find the suspect. It has now emerged he has been captured in Shelby, Charlotte, and taken into custody. Solange Knowles has also paid tribute to the victims. Writing to her two million Twitter followers, Beyonce's shocked younger sister said her thoughts are with everyone involved. "Was already weary. Was already heavy hearted. Was already tired. Where can we be safe? Where can we be free? Where can we be black?" She continued: "My heart is truly with you to the folks who lost loved ones Charleston. My heart is truly with you, world."

Last night a white gunman killed nine people at a historic African-American church in the US, in an attack branded a "hate crime". Eight victims were found dead in the church, Chief Gregory Mullen told reporters at a media conference, and a ninth person died after being taken to a hospital. One other person was wounded and receiving treatment following the shocking incident in Charleston, South Carolina.

 Mullen said: "It is unfathomable that somebody in today's society would walk into a church when people are having a prayer meeting and take their lives." But the Reverend Al Sharpton, the New York-based civil rights leader, said in a Tweet that the Reverend Clementa Pinckney, the church's pastor and a member of the state Senate, was among the fatalities. Mr Pinckney was a 41-year-old state senator, married and a father of two. The shooting occurred at the Emanuel AME Church in the historic centre of downtown Charleston around 9pm local time (1am GMT), according to Charleston Police Department spokesman Charles Francis.

 After the shooting, a bomb threat was reported near the church, Charleston County Sheriff's Office spokesman Eric Watson said, and people who were gathered in the area were told by police to move back. Chief Mullen told the press conference that the all-clear had been given after checks following the bomb threat. A police chaplain was present at the scene of the shooting, and a helicopter with a searchlight hovered overhead as officers combed through the area.

 "We pray for the families, they've got a long road ahead of them," Reverend James Johnson, a local civil rights activist, said during the impromptu prayer service. Police took a man with a backpack and a camera into custody, but later said they were still searching for a suspect in the shooting. Following the attack on the church, Republican presidential candidate Jeb Bush, the former governor of Florida, canceled an appearance in Charleston that had been scheduled for Thursday morning.

 "Governor Bush's thoughts and prayers are with the individuals and families affected by this tragedy," his campaign team said in a statement. Local broadcaster WCSC reported the FBI was on the scene but they could not be reached immediately for comment. The website for the church said it has one of the largest and oldest black congregations in the south. It has its roots in the early 19th century, and the current building was built in 1891. It is considered a historically significant building, according to the National Park Service.
