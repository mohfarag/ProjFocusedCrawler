-Wayne McGahee of Noles Digest says Jalen Ramsey has perfected the art of trash talk and backing it up on the field.
-How does the loss of Oregon stud DB Ifo Ekpre-Olomu impact what FSU does offensively? The Orlando Sentinel's Dustin Tackett (yes that Dustin Tackett) examines the loss for the Ducks. Their secondary was already pretty average with him healthy, now I expect Winston to fully exploit Oregon's pass defense.





-Ryan Kelly of Sports Talk Florida hands out some awards for Noles in the NFL. What are your thoughts on his selections?
-Tim Linafelt of Seminoles.com writes that Lamarcus Brutus has found his role on the 2014 Seminole defense after waiting his turn patiently. Good read here and Brutus has done a nice job at times for FSU. Lamarcus also has two interceptions this season for the Noles.
-Tyson Alger of The Oregonian previews the Seminole offensive line against the Oregon defensive line. I really like FSU's unit here by a pretty wide margin. Buckner and Armstead are good players but this Seminole O-line is another level right now with Cam Erving at center and Rod Johnson at left tackle.
