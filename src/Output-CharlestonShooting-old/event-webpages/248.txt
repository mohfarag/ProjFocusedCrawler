Police still searching for suspect in April murder

Posted 10:50 pm, July 8, 2015, by Chris Smith 

FacebookTwitterRedditPinterestLinkedInEmail 





ST. LOUIS (KTVI) – St. Louis police need your help in identifying a second suspect still at large for a northside murder last April.
He’s known as “Polo.”
He and another suspect are accused of shooting Cameron Wilson on April 10th at Wilson’s home on Maple near Goodfellow.
If you have any information on ‘Polo’, please call CrimeStoppers at 1-866-371-tips.
The first suspect 22-year-old Rashad Edwards has been arrested and charged with first degree murder and armed criminal action.
Edwards was arrested for unlawful use of a weapon at age 17, but did not receive the maximum penalty of four years in prison.
Instead, he received two years probation, along with court guidance.
St. Louis Police Chief Sam Dotson aired his frustrations with the courts Wednesday in a blog post.
He wrote, “What started in 2010 as a 17-year-old arrested for unlawful use of a weapon ended in 2015 with an individual almost 22 years old charged with murder.
It ended with a family losing a loved one to a crime committed by a person who had never faced life-changing consequences.”
