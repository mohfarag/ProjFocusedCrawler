STLloyd:If I were these parents I would be really angry that the police did not put 2 and 2 together a whole lot sooner.  Early on they quickly dismissed the possibility of a serial killer.  
Originally posted on The Last Refuge:
MAJOR Update: This is getting creepy, there are several indications that Jesse Leroy Matthew Jr. might be a serial perpetrator of numerous abductions.   Hannah Graham being his latest victim.
Nine victims, all of whom have disappeared in the past four years along a path that roughly follows Route 29 from Northern Virginia south to the Roanoke area: Morgan Harrington, Alexis Murphy, Cassandra Morton, Samantha Clarke, Jamisha Gilbert, Dashad “Sage” Smith, Heather Hodges, Bethany Decker and Cara Marie Holley.


Treepers – Lets see if we can collect any and all information possible on the suspect the police are now hunting. 
He is on the run.

Hannah Graham, the Virginia student who is missing, is suspected to have been abducted or harmed by a person named “Jesse Matthew”.
