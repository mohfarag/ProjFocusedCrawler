Disaster Update: Balkans

The worst floods in over a century continue to put people at risk in Serbia, Bosnia, and Herzegovina.  Landslides and unearthed landmines make the situation even more dangerous for residents and rescuers.
 
The waters have forced thousands of people out of their homes, swamped large swathes of farmland, and destroyed crops.
 
Red Cross teams are actively engaged in rescue and relief efforts. To help, you can donate via our ’cause donation’ form

Announcement
We will be changing our Disaster Online Newsroom format in the upcoming weeks (we will be rolling everything into a new webpage/format that will be easier to read/search).  As part of the transition, we will be doing a weekly update (on Fridays) that will recap what disasters we're responding to across the country.  Additionally, we will be posting any time sensitive disaster updates from our chapters.  As part of the transition to our new Disaster format, we will not be regularly posting images or stories from the field - you can find those at .
