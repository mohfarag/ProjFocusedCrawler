Typhoon Haiyan



Typhoon Haiyan survivors mark Christmas with debris trees









Survivors of typhoon Haiyan, which devastated the Philippines almost two months ago, are welcoming Christmas by building Christmas trees out of the wreckage. A Unicef worker, Angela Kearney, took these photographs in Tacloban of the 'debris trees' which she says signify the Filipino spirit.

• The Unicef Australia appeal for the Philippines is still open. You can help at
www.unicef.org.au/typhoon or phone 1300 884 233
