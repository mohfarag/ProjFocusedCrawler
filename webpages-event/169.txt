Police seek person of interest in Hannah Graham case
By Dean Seal
The (Charlottesville) Daily Progress
roanoke.com




Updated at 4:30 p.m.
The city of Charlottesville, joined by the university as well as local businesses and individuals, are offering $50,000 for any information that will shed light on the disappearance of Hannah Graham.
Police have also now released a description of the man seen in the video surveillance footage taken from the downtown mall that was last seen with his arm around Graham the night she disappeared.
A witness, who was also seen in the surveillance film walking in front of and later behind Graham, described the man as black, 5 feet and 10 to 11 inches tall, weighing between between 250 and 285 pounds, with a close shaved head, a goatee and a slight “beer belly.” The witness guessed that he was in either his late 20’s or early 30’s, and he was wearing black jeans and a white T-shirt when he was seen with Graham at the 500 blocks of East Main Street on the Downtown Mall.
Police said he is a person of interest and asks the public to call the tip line at 434-295-3851 if he is seen.

Updated at 1:30 p.m.
Efforts by city police to obtain more surveillance video from businesses on the Downtown Mall have not turned up any new leads in the investigation of Hannah Graham’s disappearance, investigators said Thursday.
Most businesses either do not have surveillance equipment or their equipment is internal, according to police Capt. Gary Pleasants.
As authorities continue investigating, students at the University of Virginia are planning a candlelight vigil Thursday night, dubbed “Bring Hannah Home.”
“We will join to demonstrate our ongoing support for Hannah’s search and loved ones,” said a press release sent out to by the UVa Student Council. “We will join to celebrate the unyielding hope that Hannah will come back to us.”
During the event, held at 9 p.m. at the McIntire Amphitheater, students will perform some of Graham’s favorite music, her favorite candy will be served, and memories of Graham will be shared.

The search for missing University of Virginia student Hannah Graham will likely continue for several days, officials say.
Albemarle County Sheriff J.E. "Chip" Harding said the search command center has been moved to the Carver Recreation Center in downtown Charlottesville to provide a more comfortable location for a search likely to last for a while.
"It looks like it's going to go for a few more days and we wanted to have a more permanent location with more room," Harding said. "It also allows us a center from which to work should we need to send search teams to more remote areas."
Search teams from the Virginia Department of Emergency Management hit the city streets again this morning looking for Graham, Harding said.
"They met with investigators to look at probable areas to be searched based on what information investigators found overnight," Harding said. "Charlottesville is 10 square miles and Albemarle County is 723 square miles and it's important to determine what areas to look at."
Harding said his volunteer search and rescue team is helping out state search teams, but has surrendered the lead in the search.
"We've played a pretty small role overall in this," he said. "We can't maintain a long-term search because we're volunteers and we need to continue working. We help out when we can."
Efforts by city police to obtain more surveillance video from businesses on the Downtown Mall have not turned up any new leads in the investigation of Hannah Graham’s disappearance, investigators said Thursday.
Most businesses either do not have surveillance equipment or their equipment is internal, according to police Capt. Gary Pleasants.
A man seen in surveillance video video following a missing University of Virginia student on the Downtown Mall early Saturday told police late Wednesday that Hannah Graham "looked to be somewhat physically distressed" and that he wanted to make sure she was safe. He also told police that he saw another man speak with Graham.
The man in the video, who is white, came to the police department at 10:15 p.m. Wednesday, the agency said in a news release. In addition to describing his own actions, he told officers that soon after he followed Graham a black male came up to her and put his around around her and stopped her. The two began speaking, the man told police.

"It appeared to the witness that the black male was either known to Ms. Graham or was trying to help her," police said. "The witness then walked away and he said that Ms. Graham and the black male were still standing and talking when he left. The black male is not shown in either of these videos."


Police said the white man, explaining his actions, told police Graham "looked to be somewhat physically distressed and he wanted to make sure she got safely to wherever she was going."


The man was not identified by police.


The video was recorded from Sal's Pizza at 1:06 a.m. and from Tuel's Jewelers at 1:08 a.m., police said.

The search for Hannah Graham continues, four days after the second-year student went missing.
Police spent much of Wednesday scouring the mall and working to gather more video, capped in the afternoon with a plea for help from city Police Chief Timothy Longo, who asked that anyone who might have seen her contact a tip line set up and manned by the FBI.
“I’d be very disturbed that someone on this Downtown Mall did not see that young lady, or has not called the police to report [that they did],” Longo said. “I’m hoping that they’re hearing my words and seeing my frustration, hearing the pain that this family is experiencing, pick up the phone and tell us something, regardless of how insignificant you think it might be.”
Two new videos emerged late Wednesday showing Graham, 18, on the Downtown Mall after 1 a.m. Saturday with two people walking nearby.
Police said she met friends for dinner Friday evening at a restaurant on The Corner. According to friends, police said, she left alone about 11 p.m. and proceeded to at least two other locations — Camden Plaza apartments and a house party near 14th Street Northwest — a short distance away. Police said they believe Graham lost her bearings after leaving the second location, heading north on 10th Street Northwest.
She was seen on video surveillance near McGrady’s Pub on Grady Avenue walking west past the bar at 12:43 a.m. A few minutes later, she was seen in video walking to the door of the bar before continuing east on Preston Avenue. Police said she never entered the bar. Police are seeking to speak with the pub’s doorman. Management at McGrady’s Pub has been advised by police not to comment.
A second surveillance video shows Graham walking past a Shell station on Preston Avenue at 12:55 a.m., first running and then slowing to a stop. Police said it did not seem that she was followed at that time.
Minutes later, an eyewitness sitting in her car spotted Graham walking south from Market Street toward the Downtown Mall.
Late Wednesday night, Capt. Gary Pleasants of Charlottesville police said new video surveillance, time stamped at 1:06 a.m. Saturday, shows a white male walking down the 200 block of East Main Street, who “glances briefly over his shoulder, then steps into a doorway and stops.” Moments later, Graham is seen walking by the same doorway, and the white male steps out and follows her.
In a second video, filmed two minutes later in the 300 block of East Main Street, Graham appears to be accompanied by someone, who may be male or female, and the same white male is following close behind.
No additional information was gleaned from the new footage Wednesday night.
Longo said police contacted other local merchants who have surveillance equipment and asked them to hold the tapes so they could be reviewed. He said there are no city surveillance cameras on the Downtown Mall, something Longo said he has long sought from the city council.
Text messages sent about 1:20 a.m. to friends from Graham’s phone said that she was lost near 14th Street Northwest, though police said that because of the direction she was heading, they doubt she was in that location when the texts were sent.
Longo said Graham appeared to have been drinking, based on accounts from people who were at parties she had attended. He said that spoke to her potential vulnerability at the time of her disappearance, Longo said. He lamented that her level of intoxication had become a focal point in some corners.
“Folks have gone very quickly to that issue and have attacked the character of this young lady, and I think unfairly,” the chief said. “I find it unfortunate that people are latching onto that, and speaking poorly of a young lady’s character — an individual they don’t even know.”
Graham’s parents, who have chosen to speak only through police and the University of Virginia, said in a statement they suspected “foul play” and called it “totally out of character” for their daughter not to contact them.
“Hannah is beyond precious to us and we are truly devastated by her disappearance,” the statement said. “We will not rest until we find her, and she comes home.”
Charlottesville police have asked landowners near the Downtown Mall to search their property for traces of Graham.
“I can’t imagine — as a parent, as a husband — I can’t imagine what [Graham’s parents and family] are going through these past couple of days,” Longo said. “This department’s focus is to find their daughter — first and foremost, to find their daughter — and by the grace of God to return her to their care.”
While police continue their search, UVa President Teresa Sullivan issued a statement Wednesday recommending that parents keep in contact with their students and encourage them to seek counseling, if needed.
“If your son or daughter seems to be in distress, do not hesitate to refer them to professional counseling if you believe it would be helpful for them. UVa’s Counseling and Psychological Services department has trained clinicians who can help students manage anxiety or other emotions they may be feeling,” Sullivan wrote.
“You are perhaps the most important resource for your student. Many students will seek advice and reassurance from their families,” Sullivan wrote. “If you become concerned about your student’s resilience or health, please let me, Vice President Pat Lampkin, or [UVa Dean of Students Allen Groves] know of your concerns.”
Sullivan sent a similar message Tuesday to staff and faculty.
“We are encouraging our students to maintain their daily schedules. Having structure in their day will help them in coping with uncertainty, and I hope that those of you who teach and support our students will help them stay on track,” she wrote.
“If students come to you in distress, I know that you will be understanding and listen to them carefully, but you should also not hesitate to refer them to professional counseling if you believe it would be helpful for them.”
Authorities describe Graham as white, 5 feet, 11 inches tall, with a slender build, blue eyes, light brown hair and freckles. Anyone with more information is urged to contact the police tip line at 434-295-3851.
