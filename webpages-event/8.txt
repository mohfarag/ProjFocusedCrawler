Hannah Graham, 18, is described as 5 feet 11 inches tall with blue eyes, light brown hair and freckles. (Charlottesville Police Dept.)


Missing University of Virginia student Hannah Graham has now been missing for three weeks. Over 100 investigators spent the weekend scouring the countryside outside Charlottesville in hopes of finding the missing 18-year-old.
Charlottesville Police Chief Timothy Longo said police have fielded over 3,000 tips from the public. Longo says officers have been using all-terrain vehicles, aircraft, and mounted officers to navigate the mountainous and hilly areas. 
"We're aggressively searching every piece of Albemarle County. Every square inch of Albemarle County is being searched this weekend. And we're gonna find Hannah Graham," Longo said.
Searchers are trying to finish examining an 8-mile radius around the area where Hannah Graham disappeared. Search leader Mark Eggeman with the Virginia Department of Emergency Management says they had more crews this weekend.
"Right now it appears that we're going to have somewhere between 120 and 150 people here over the weekend. So there's a lot of logistical efforts going on in the background to make all this possible to make it happen," Eggeman says.
Additionally, a plane with high quality cameras was part of the search. Eggeman asked hunters beginning the season this weekend and folks outside enjoying the weather to keep their eyes open for leads.
"Somewhere out there, there's a little girl that needs to come home," he says.
Hannah Graham's mother Sue issued an emotional statement over the weekend, thanking the volunteers and police for their hard work and pressing people with information about her daughter's disappearance to speak to police.
“Somebody listening to me today either knows where Hannah is, or knows someone who has that information. We appeal to you to come forward and tell us where Hannah can be found," she said.
Graham has not been seen for more than three weeks now and Jesse Matthew, the man accused of abducting her is in police custody, but isn't talking to investigators. He has been charged with "abduction with intent to defile."
