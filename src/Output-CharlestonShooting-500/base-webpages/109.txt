Why choose predominately African American church? We don't know,” presiding elder the Rev. Benjamin Finnell said.Finnell leads the AME Omaha District. He also leads Allen Chapel near 30th and Monroe streets. He said just as violence is evil, so is racism. It’s a sign of weakness in society that the power of prayer can overcome.“To me it’s a saddening statement as to the moral and spiritual condition of our nation at this time,” Finnell said.
