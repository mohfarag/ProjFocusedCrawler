Army tightens grip as protesters slam power grab

Burkina Faso's army seized control of the capital's main square yesterday, firing tear gas and shots in the air to disperse thousands of protesters denouncing a power grab by the military.

Troops moved into Place de la Nation in Ouagadougou and took over the national television headquarters, in both a show of force and defiance against calls by the international community and protesters for a return to civilian rule.The military had stepped into the power vacuum left by president Blaise Compaore, who was forced to resign in the wake of violent street demonstrations over his 27-year-rule of the west African state that some have likened to the Arab Spring.But international mediators brandished the threat of sanctions if the army refused to back down and allow a civilian transfer of power.The UN envoy for west Africa, Mohamed Ibn Chambas, told a news conference in the Burkinabe capital that he and African leaders had pressed the demand in a meeting with the country's top military brass.Thousands of protesters, furious at plans to extend Compaore's rule , had massed on the streets of Ouagadougou on Thursday, some going on a rampage and setting the parliament and other public buildings ablaze.Under Burkina Faso's constitution, the speaker of parliament was supposed to step in as interim head of state following the president's resignation.But the army instead named the second-in-command of the presidential guard, Lieutenant Colonel Isaac Zida, as head of the transitional authority.Zida, 49, said he was appointed to ensure a "smooth democratic transition" and promised to consult political opposition and civil leaders.He met yesterday with opposition leaders including the bloc's main chief Zephirin Diabre, former prime minister Roch Marc Christian Kabore and ex-foreign minister Ablasse Ouedraogo.The talks took place after several thousand people joined a march against the military earlier yesterday.Some protesters headed to the national television headquarters, where two opposition leaders sought to go on air to declare themselves interim chief.The mediators from the UN, the African Union and the Economic Community of West African States told Zida and other military leaders that civilian rule needed to be restored.They "assured us that they had well understood the message", Chambas said.But US State Department spokeswoman Jan Psaki voiced international mistrust at the army's move, saying the United States condemned its attempt to "impose its will" on the people of Burkina Faso.
