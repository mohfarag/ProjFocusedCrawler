 10.19pm AEST08:19 

“America does not have a monopoly on racism. But what makes its racism so lethal is the ease with which people can acquire guns,” writes Guardian columnist Gary Younge on Comment is free.


While the new conversation around race will mean the political response to the fact of this attack will be different, the stale conversation around gun control means the legislative response to the nature of this attack will remain the same. Nothing will happen.
After Adam Lanza shot 20 primary school children and six adults in Sandy Hook, Connecticut, in 2012 before turning his gun on himself, nothing happened. Seven children and teens are shot dead every day in America and nothing happens.
So these nine victims will join those who perished before them – a sacrifice to the blood-soaked pedestal erected around the constitution’s second amendment that gun lobbyists say guarantees the right of individuals to bear arms. Where guns are concerned this is what passes for American exceptionalism – an 18th century compromise with fatal 21st century ramifications. For the parishioners of the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston nothing will ever be the same again. And for those who have the power to prevent it happening again, nothing will change.

 10.16pm AEST08:16 

Rev John Paul Brown, who will be leading prayers for the victims in Charleston, has urged the community against any retaliation for the attack. Speaking to WBTV he said: “At this point there is so much healing that is needed.” He said if the community chose to fight violence with violence it would lose. “As a faith community we would kill everything that we stand for [if we resorted to violence].” 
He then added this cryptic appeal” “Somebody knows something and we are depending that those people who know something think about the humanity about what should be done. And I believe it’s going to be a quick resolve.”

Summary

Here’s an updated summary of what we know so far: 

Six women and three men were killed when a white suspect opened fired in the historic black church of Emanuel AME church in Charleston, South Carolina. 
Police are still hunting for a suspect, described as a “highly dangerous” white male, aged between 21 and 25. They have released CCTV images of the suspect and his car. 
The shooting is being investigated as a hate crime. “There is absolutely no doubt in my mind that it is hate crime,” Police Chief Greg Mullen told a news conference without elaborating. 
The suspect was in the church for about hour before opening fire. 
One of those killed has been named as Clementa Pinckney, Emanuel church’s pastor and a Democratic member of the South Carolina Senate. He had campaigned for police to wear body cameras. The police said they did not know if anyone was targeted in the killing. 
Eight people were dead when police arrived on the scene, following an emergency call on Wednesday evening just after 9pm local time. A ninth person died later in hospital.
Three people survived the attack, police said. There are unconfirmed reports that the suspect allowed one of the survivors to leave the church so she could report what happened. The police are continuing to interview survivors. 
Republican presidential hopeful Jeb Bush has cancelled a planned campaign event in South Carolina on Thursday. Hillary Clinton, who campaigned in Charleston earlier on Wednesday and is believed to have met Pinckney, said the news was “heartbreaking”.
South Carolina governor Nikki Haley said: We’ll never understand what motivates anyone to enter one of our places of worship and take the life of another.
Questions are being asked about racial tensions in the state, where Walter Scott, a black man, was shot dead by a police officer in April, and the confederate flag still flies in the grounds of the state building. The NAACP said it was outraged at what it described as a senseless and cowardly killing. 
The Emanuel AME church has a rich history, including a visit from Martin Luther King.

NAACP expresses outrage

The NAACP has expressed its outrage at what it says were senseless and cowardly killings. 
Its president Cornell Brooks put out this statement: 


The NAACP was founded to fight against racial hatred and we are outraged that 106 years later, we are faced today with another mass hate crime. Our heartfelt prayers and soul-deep condolences go out to the families and community of the victims at Charleston’s historic Emanuel AME Church. The senselessly slain parishioners were in a church for Wednesday night bible study. There is no greater coward than a criminal who enters a house of God and slaughters innocent people engaged in the study of scripture. Today I mourn as an AME minister, as a student and teacher of scripture, as well as a member of the NAACP. 
The NAACP South Carolina State Conference and Charleston Branch have been working on the ground—with police and the community to bring this case to a close. We remain vigilant while the local police and FBI investigate this hate crime and bring the shooter to justice.

Summary



Claire Phipps

Here is what we know so far, as police in South Carolina continue to hunt for a gunman who shot dead nine people in their church in Charleston:

Nine people have died after a gunman entered the Emanuel AME church in Charleston.
Police are still hunting a suspect, described as a white male, aged about 21.
The shooting is being investigated as a hate crime.
One of those killed has been named as Clementa Pinckney, Emanuel church’s pastor and a Democratic member of the South Carolina Senate.
Eight people were dead when police arrived on the scene, following an emergency call on Wednesday evening just after 9pm local time.
A ninth person died later in hospital.
At least one other person was taken to hospital. Police would not confirm the number of survivors or their condition.
Police and the mayor are due to hold a further press conference at 7am local time (noon BST/9pm AEST).

Republican presidential hopeful Jeb Bush has cancelled a planned campaign event in South Carolina on Thursday. Hillary Clinton, who campaigned in Charleston earlier on Wednesday and is believed to have met Pinckney, said the news was “heartbreaking”.
South Carolina governor Nikki Haley said:



 We’ll never understand what motivates anyone to enter one of our places of worship and take the life of another.



 But questions are being asked about racial tensions in the state, where Walter Scott, a black South Carolina man was shot dead by a police officer in April, and the confederate flag still flies in the grounds of the state building.
Pinckney helped lead a prayer vigil for Scott, and campaigned for legislation to require police officers to wear body cameras. The requirement became law one week ago.
The Emanuel AME church has a rich history, including a visit from Martin Luther King.
A man handcuffed by police officers earlier on Wednesday evening, fitting the description of the suspect, has been released and is not considered a suspect.
The suspect is described as a white male, aged about 21, slender and clean-shaven. He was said to be wearing a grey sweatshirt, blue jeans and Timberland boots.

I’m handing over this blog to my colleague Matthew Weaver now. We will continue to bring you the latest updates as the story unfolds.

 5.56pm AEST03:56 

My colleague Matthew Weaver has put together this profile of Clementa Pinckney, the pastor shot dead in his church with eight others:

In April Pinckney helped lead a prayer vigil for Walter Scott, a black South Carolina man who was shot dead by a police officer as he tried to run away.
Pinckney campaigned for legislation to require police officers to wear body cameras while working. He said: “Body cameras help to record what happens. It may not be the golden ticket, the golden egg, the end-all-fix-all, but it helps to paint a picture of what happens during a police stop.”
The Rev Joseph Darby, the presiding elder at Beaufort AME Church, described Pinckney as “an advocate for the people”. He told MSNBC: “He was a very caring and competent pastor, and he was a very brave man. Brave men sometimes die difficult deaths.”

Pinckney leaves a wife, Jennifer, and two children, Eliana and Malana.

 5.49pm AEST03:49 
Clementa Pinckney named among the dead

Multiple reports have said that Rev Clementa Pinckney, Emanuel church’s pastor and a Democratic member of the South Carolina Senate, was among the nine people killed.
This has yet to be officially confirmed by Charleston police or the coroner, but South Carolina state house minority leader Todd Rutherford has told the Associated Press that Pinckney was among those killed:


He never had anything bad to say about anybody, even when I thought he should.
He was always out doing work either for his parishioners or his constituents. He touched everybody. 


Pinckney, 41, was a married father of two who was elected to the state house at age 23, making him the youngest member at the time. He was elected to the South Carolina Senate in 2000.

I’m hearing that Charleston police chief Greg Mullen and mayor Joseph Riley will hold another press conference at 7am local time (noon BST/9pm AEST), in around four hours’ time.
It’s not yet clear whether we will hear at that point, or before, the identities of those killed. So far, despite many reports on social media, no names have been confirmed.
Authorities have also so far declined to say how many people survived – though we know at least one person is in hospital – and what is their condition.

Following the shooting, a group of pastors huddled together praying in a circle across the street.
Community organiser Christopher Cason told reporters he felt certain the shootings were racially motivated. 


I am very tired of people telling me that I don’t have the right to be angry.
I am very angry right now.


Even before the killing of local black man Walter Scott by a white police officer in April, Cason said he had been part of a group meeting with police and local leaders to try to shore up better relationships.

 4.20pm AEST02:20 

Charleston’s police chief has said the shooting is being investigated as a hate crime.
South Carolina has faced claims of systemic racism, reports my colleague Tom Dart:

The shooting happened in the heart of downtown Charleston, a wealthy area which is one of the most historic and popular tourist destinations in the US and only a couple of blocks from the College of Charleston, which has about 12,000 students.
Racial tensions were raised by the death of Walter Scott, a black man shot in the back by a white police officer in April in North Charleston, an adjacent city of about 100,000 people where nearly half the population is black. Protestors said the killing was evidence of systemic racism in the state. 
The Confederate flag, which many African-Americans see as a symbol of racial hatred, flew on top of the state capitol building in Columbia until 2000 and is still on display in the grounds on a pole in front of the capitol.


The black population of central Charleston has sharply declined amid rising house prices and gentrification, reversing the “white flight” that happened after desegregation of schools in the 1960s, according to a Post and Courier article from last year.

 4.02pm AEST02:02 

The Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal church has a rich history, Associated Press reports:

The Emmanuel AME church is a historic African-American church that traces its roots to 1816, when several churches split from Charleston’s Methodist Episcopal church.
One of its founders, Denmark Vesey, tried to organize a slave revolt in 1822. He was caught, and white landowners had his church burned in revenge. Parishioners worshipped underground until after the Civil War.

The church’s own website says it is the oldest AME church in the south, with “one of the largest and oldest black congregations south of Baltimore”:

The wooden two-story church that was built on the present site in 1872 was destroyed by the devastating earthquake of August 31, 1886.
The present edifice was completed in 1891.

Rev Clementa Pinckney – pastor of Emanuel AME church and a Democratic member of the South Carolina Senate, who was inside the church at the time of the shooting – helped lead a prayer vigil in April for Walter Scott, a black South Carolina man who was shot dead by a police officer.
Pinckney campaigned for legislation to require law enforcement officials to wear body cameras while working, saying:


Body cameras help to record what happens.
It may not be the golden ticket, the golden egg, the end-all-fix-all, but it helps to paint a picture of what happens during a police stop. 


The body camera requirement became law one week ago.
It is not clear whether Pinckney survived the shooting.

Here are some more of the comments from the police press conference, at which it was confirmed that nine people were shot dead in the attack on the Emanuel AME church.
Police chief Greg Mullen said:


At 9.05 we received a call on a shooting that occurred here in Charleston. When officers arrived they found a number of victims inside and we had individuals transported to the trauma centre.
There were eight deceased inside the church.


Another person died later in hospital, Mullen said:


At this point we have nine victims in this heinous crime that has been committed.



I believe this was a hate crime. It will be investigated as a hate crime.

Mayor Joseph P Riley Jr called the shooting an “unspeakable tragedy”:


The most dastardly act that one can possibly imagine.
The message is this is one hateful person that did these dastardly deeds.

My colleague Michael Safi files this report on the latest developments:

At least nine people have been killed after a gunman opened fire at a historic black church in Charleston, South Carolina, in what police have described as a hate crime.
A bomb threat was also briefly issued after security services swarmed the area around the Emanuel AME Church, whose pastor Clementa Pinckney, a Democratic member of the South Carolina Senate, was said to be present at the time of the shooting.
Police have not confirmed the identities of the victims, eight of whom were killed in the church, another dying later in hospital.
Charleston police chief Greg Mullen said there were survivors, but declined to give more details.
The suspect, who is still on the loose, has been described as a clean-shaved, white male aged approximately 21, with a small, slender build, wearing a grey sweatshirt with jeans and boots.
Mullen said he believed the shooting was “a hate crime”.
The city’s mayor, Joseph P Riley Jr, described the killing as an “unspeakable tragedy”, pledging to catch “this awful person and bring him to justice as soon as possible”.
He said he had met with relatives of the victims in a “heartbreaking scene”.
South Carolina governor Nikki Haley said details of the shooting were still unclear, but “we do know that we’ll never understand what motivates anyone to enter one of our places of worship and take the life of another”.
“Please join us in lifting up the victims and their families with our love and prayers,” she said.
Presidential candidate Jeb Bush has cancelled a planned trip to the state, and the South Carolina legislature has suspended a sitting planned for Thursday.

My colleague Tom Dart sends this background:

South Carolina is no stranger to mass shootings. Six people died in Greenwood, 180 miles from Charleston, in 2013 when Bryan Sweatt killed three adults, two children and himself using a handgun as the result of a domestic dispute.
In 2011, Susan Hendricks shot dead her two sons, her ex-husband and her stepmother in the small town of Liberty.
After being fired from his job at a lawnmower equipment factory in Aiken County in 1997, Hastings Wise returned weeks later and killed four employees with a semiautomatic gun, injuring three others. He was executed in 2005.

My colleague Erin McCann has some background on the church targeted in tonight’s attack:

The Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church is the oldest such house of worship in the American south. It is one of the oldest and largest black congregations south of Baltimore, according to its website. 
Its congregation is led by the Reverend Clementa Pinckney, a Democratic representative in the state senate.
The church was burned in the 1820s during an investigation into a slave rebellion, according to a church history.
Its worship services went underground from 1834, when black worship was outlawed, until 1865, when the American civil war ended. It has stood at its present site since 1872.

There is very little official information so far, as police concentrate their efforts on tracking down the suspect.
It has been reported that a bible study group was meeting in the church at the time of the shooting.
I should stress that at this point we cannot confirm media reports that a number of people have been killed.

A gunman has opened fire at a church in Charleston, South Carolina, and was still at large, a police official has said. 
Charleston Police Department spokesman Charles Francis told Reuters the shooting occurred at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal (AME) Church around 9pm local time.
He said police were still searching for a suspect.
The suspect was described as a white male, slender, aged around 21, wearing a grey sweatshirt, jeans and boots. He was clean-shaven.
