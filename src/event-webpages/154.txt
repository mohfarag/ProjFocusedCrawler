Summary

We're going to wrap up our live blog coverage for the day. Here's a summary of where things stand:
• Hundreds of thousands of displaced people in the Philippines entered a third night without secure shelter as the central eastern coastline lay destroyed from the passage of typhoon Haiyan on Friday. 
• The Philippines government counted at least 1,774 dead, "with many more expected in Leyte Province," according to a US state department fact sheet. Hundreds were buried at one mass grave site. Many dead remained in the streets and in flooded areas.
• Search and rescue efforts continued as aid efforts ramped up. The World Food Program estimates that 2.5m people are in need of food. Survivors gathered outside Tacloban airport in hopes of greeting aid shipments but some left empty-handed.
• The United States has committed $20m in aid and has sent aircraft, ships and troops to support the Philippine military. International aid groups and governments around the world were sending food, clothing, medicine and emergency supplies. For a list of aid activities click here.
• Philippine climate change commissioner Yeb Saño made a passionate call for action on climate change. "To anyone who continues to deny the reality that is climate change, I dare you to get off your ivory tower and away from the comfort of you armchair."
• A tropical depression is forecast to bring rain to the central and southern Philippines on Tuesday. Forecasts for San Antonia, in the northwest, put the chance of rain Tuesday and Wednesday at 60%.

 9.35pm GMT16:35 

The scale of devastation from Haiyan owes not only to the storm's strength but also to the vulnerability of Filipinos living in relatively flimsy housing and without ways of fleeing the storm. Max Fisher writes in the Washington Post on the storm's impact:

The single most important factor may be that, quite simply, this storm was just too big; with winds well beyond 200 miles per hour and sea levels surging across coastal communities, no country could absorb it unharmed. But the Philippines seems to have been particularly ill-suited to deal with this crisis.
One of clearest explanations for the Philippines' unpreparedness may, sadly, also be one of the most difficult to address: its poverty. The country is ranked 165th in the world by GDP per capita, just below the Republic of Congo. One result is that many homes are modestly constructed of light materials like wood. Another is that the government has fewer resources to invest in infrastructure that could resist natural disasters and be used for relief efforts. 

Read the full piece here. 
Update: journalist Rania Khalek thinks Fisher should have gone more into the long-term sources of poverty in the Philippines. That seems outside the scope of the piece in question but points to a worthy subject for inquiry. See this earlier post for more about the US military presence in the Philippines.

A new US state department fact sheet on Haiyan contains a higher official death toll figure, 1,774 "with many more expected in Leyte Province," according to McClatchy's @HannahAllam. The World Food Program estimates that 2.5m people are in need of food.

 8.36pm GMT15:36 

At least 9.7 million people in 41 Philippine provinces were affected by the disaster, the Associated Press reports. An AP slide show of the disaster area and aid efforts is here. 
The northwestern Pacific, where Typhoon Haiyan has just hit, is the busiest region on Earth for these kinds of storms, AP explains:

A normal year there involves 27 named storms. Haiyan is the 28th named storm and there has already been a 29th. By comparison the Atlantic averages 11 named storms a year and this year there have been 12, none of them causing major problems.

The name applied to such a storm – hurricane, cyclone, typhoon – depends on where they take shape:

HURRICANE? CYCLONE? TYPHOON? They're all the same, officially tropical cyclones. But they just use distinctive terms for a storm in different parts of the world. Hurricane is used in the Atlantic, Caribbean Sea, central and northeast Pacific. They are typhoons in the northwest Pacific. In the Bay of Bengal and the Arabia Sea, they are called cyclones. Tropical cyclone is used in the southwest India Ocean; in the southwestern Pacific and southeastern India Ocean they are severe tropical cyclones.

 7.46pm GMT14:46 

We've taken down an image we had posted, which has been widely distributed online, overlaying a satellite image of Haiyan on a map of the United States.
The image, meant to illustrate the storm's incredible size, was tweeted by the American Red Cross (which later apologized for the misleading tweet).
However the image appears not to represent the actual size of the storm, Nate Cohn points out in the New Republic.

So Haiyan was large, but it was not even CLOSE to the size of the United States. The central dense overcast--the strong convection ringing the eye that's colored black in the hoax--is only about the size of the southern most island of the Philippines, not the entire southeast of the United States.

Summary

Here's a summary of where things stand:
• Search and rescue efforts struggled forward in the Philippines three days after typhoon Haiyan swept through with 150-mph winds and waters that rose by 20 feet in some areas. Thousands are feared dead. An early official count of 10 of 40 towns in the hardest-hit province of Leyte put the toll at 1,563 dead.
• Hundreds of thousands of Filipinos were driven from their homes, many of which were destroyed in the storm. Entire settlements lay underwater, with no power, phone service or relief access. Many people inside and outside the country awaited news of loved ones.
• International aid organizations and governments worldwide have joined the relief effort. Click here for the latest information about relief efforts. The US military, which no longer has a permanent base in the country, sent ships and aircraft from Japan and elsewhere.
• Survivors endured a third day with limited access to food and fresh water. Many residents were trapped in flooded areas. Officials feared a broader humanitarian crisis. Further rain was forecast to begin falling Tuesday. 
• The storm progressed to Vietnam and made landfall in China, where initial reports from about two hours ago said seven people had died.

Rather than a careless, wanky reply (cheers Jimmyji), the best place to start is likely to be the Google's People Finder (http://google.org/personfinder/global/home.html) or the Philippine Red Cross's Social Services Restoring Family Links and Tracing Services, call 09175328500.
Good luck.

The Guardian's Kayla Epstein (@KaylaEpstein) has put together a Twitter list of international aid organizations and Philippine and US officials to track the Haiyan relief effort. You can follow for updates here. 
A list compiled by the Guardian of global aid agencies working to provide relief in the Philippines is here. A second list from the Associated Press is here. 
An overview of US relief efforts is here. The US has sent ships, aircraft and troops to the Philippines from Japan and elsewhere in the Pacific to perform search-and-rescue work and deliver provisions and generators. Additionally:

The US embassy in Manilla immediately released $100,000 to provide food, water, sanitation and other humanitarian resources. 
The secretary of state, John Kerry, said on Monday the department was working with a US nonprofit called the mGive Foundation to coordinate financial and material donations via mobile phones. Kerry said: "Our embassies in the Philippines and Palau are in close and constant contact with their partners in local governments to direct aid to the right places. When I spoke with Philippines foreign minister, Albert del Rosario, I assured him of our full commitment to providing all necessary assistance.”
The embassy posted on its Facebook page a list of aid organisations it has worked with in the past, to help those looking to donate money to relief efforts.

Read the full piece here. 
The UN refugee agency, already stretched by the refugee crisis in Syria and elsewhere, also is responding to the disaster in the Philippines, shipping 1,400 protection kits and hygiene kits containing basic items such as plastic sheets, blankets, mosquito nets, soap and underwear. UNHCR also plans to send a Boeing 747 flight from Dubai on Wednesday carrying 2,500 tents and to distribute 50,000 solar lanterns in the area. Visit the UNHCR page here.

Lynette Lim, who works with Save the Children, was in Tacloban City when the storm struck. She has written a first-person account for the Guardian. "The area has seen typhoons every year – just not of this magnitude," she writes:

I think I went in quite mentally prepared for the typhoon but I was surprised by how strong it was. The devastation I was not prepared for. People were just in shock. They couldn't believe how powerful the storm was. People began to leave the evacuation centre [near us] – the roofs and windows had been smashed. People there really suffered from the storm surge and used a bed as a raft to float to our building and climb to the second floor.
They were trying to go home, look for relatives, make sure everyone was safe and salvage what was left of their homes – pretty much nothing. There were families who had left a family member behind to protect the house from being looted. There was a lot of debris and a lot of flooding. There were trees and fallen electricity lines strewn everywhere. On the side of the road people were laying out dead bodies covered in clothes and whatever they could find. There were children as well as adults.
I saw a dozen or so. But I am sure there are many in coastal areas that have not been retrieved or in places that completely flattened there must be a lot of bodies under there.

"On Saturday, everyone was desperate for food," Lim writes. "By midday we saw looting for basic supplies, which escalated the day after into whatever they could get." Read the full piece here.

 4.33pm GMT11:33 

For decades after the second World War, the United States maintained one of its largest overseas military installations at Subic Bay just west of Manila in the Philippines. The base closed in 1992, after the 1991 eruption of Mt Pinatubo covered the base in volcanic ash and efforts to extend a joint treaty failed. The US marines now charged with providing relief in the islands have flown in from Okinawa, Japan, another controversial base.
Negotiations for a larger US presence in the Philippines have picked up recently as the US seeks to counter regional Chinese influence. President Obama was scheduled to visit the country in October to nudge forward a new security accord, but the trip was canceled because of the government shutdown. Felix K. Chang, senior fellow of the Foreign Policy Research Institute, has published a history of the US presence in the Philippines in Real Clear World:

Indeed, ahead of President Barack Obama's originally planned visit to Manila in October 2013, both countries were working on a new security accord, called the Increased Rotational Presence (IRP) Agreement. Once in effect, it would allow American forces to more regularly rotate through the island country for joint U.S.-Philippine military exercises, focusing on maritime security, maritime domain awareness, and humanitarian assistance and disaster relief. The new agreement would also allow the United States to preposition the combat equipment used by its forces at Philippine military bases. That, in turn, would save the time and fuel needed to fly in such equipment and keep it close at hand in case of a crisis. Eventually, the frequency of U.S.-Philippine exercises could increase to the point where there would be a near-continuous American military presence in the Philippines.

Summary

Here's a summary of where things stand:
• Thousands were killed and tens of thousands endangered when a historically powerful typhoon, Haiyan, struck the southeastern Philippines Friday, flooding densely populated coastal areas, knocking out power and leveling neighborhoods. The storm is known as Yolanda locally.
• Official government figures have put the toll at 1,563 confirmed dead in Leyte, the hardest-hit province, with only 10 of 40 towns accounted for. But the number has been climbing steeply as search-and-rescue efforts begin. Hard-hit areas remained beyond the reach of aid workers and telcom contact.
• Many people suffered a third day without access to clean water or food, and a broader humanitarian crisis was feared. Aid groups called for a large international disaster response. A list of relief organizations and efforts is here. The UN estimated that 600,000 have been internally displaced.
• The storm progressed to Vietnam and made landfall in China, where initial reports from about two hours ago said seven people had died.

 3.23pm GMT10:23 

Victims of the storm are being buried in mass graves and the number of internally displaced Filipinos runs to the hundreds of thousands, according to the United Nations. Reuters reports:

The United Nations said officials in Tacloban, which bore the brunt of the storm on Friday, had reported one mass grave of 300-500 bodies. More than 600,000 people were displaced by the storm across the country and some have no access to food, water, or medicine, the U.N. says. [...]
Haiyan, one of the strongest typhoons ever recorded, is estimated to have destroyed about 70 to 80 percent of structures in its path. The damage to the coconut- and rice-growing region was expected to amount to more than 3 billion pesos ($69 million), Citi Research said in a report, with "massive losses" for private property.
Bodies litter the streets of Tacloban, rotting and swelling under the sun. People walked covering their noses with rags or old clothes to mask the stench.

My colleagues John Vidal and Adam Vaughan have more on Yeb Saño's speech in Warsaw here:

The Philippines government has firmly connected the super typhoon Haiyan with climate change, and urged governments meeting in Poland on Monday to take emergency action to resolve the deadlocked climate talks.
"We cannot sit and stay helpless staring at this international climate stalemate. It is now time to take action. We need an emergency climate pathway," said Yeb Sano, head of the government's delegation to the UN climate talks, in an article for the Guardian, in which he challenged climate sceptics to "get off their ivory towers" to see the impacts of climate change firsthand.
Sano, whose family comes from the devastated town of Tacloban where the typhoon Haiyan made landfall on Friday, said that countries such as the Philippines did not have time to wait for an international climate deal, which countries have agreed to reach in Paris in 2015 ...

A bit more from Sandra Bulling, who describes the scene that greeted the Care International team as they arrived by boat in Ormoc city:

As soon as we stepped onto the port, we were in the middle of a disaster zone. Everything was destroyed. Tin roofing sheets were hanging off trees like wet blankets.
All the houses along the coast are completely flattened. Everything is destroyed. Further inland, about 80% of the houses are roofless. About five percent of the houses are completely collapsed – these are mainly wooden houses.
It seems like everyone we’ve seen has a hammer or tools in their hands, trying to repair their houses and their roofs. People are picking up poles and pieces of wood from the street. There are long queues at hardware stores, pharmacies. We waited in line for two hours to get fuel. So far the roads are okay, but it’s taking a long time to get anywhere.
 I talked to a shop owner whose shop was destroyed; he lost everything. He’s wondering how he’s going to feed his five children. I also met a little girl, who was trying to dry out her books. Her house was totally destroyed, but there she was, worried about her school books, because she wants to go to school. And it’s the only thing she has left.

Sandra Bulling, an aid worker with Care International, has sent this account from Jaro, a small town on the way to Tacloban.

It’s dark now, so we can’t go any further. We’re staying in the police station tonight – not sure where we’ll sleep, maybe in the car, or outside.
There’s an electricity pole that’s leaning dangerously over the police station, so everyone is trying to steer clear of that. Thank you to the police for letting us use their toilets! Our plan is to go to Dulag, just south of Tacloban. Our driver just came from there, and says it’s very bad, and they need help.
People are becoming quite desperate. Some officials just came and told us that there has been looting in the area, people trying to get rice for their families. People haven’t had food for three days, and they’re trying to feed their families.
That’s why it’s so important to get food and emergency supplies in to these areas as soon as possible. In Ormoc [the port where we arrived], there was food; we could buy chicken and rice.
But there were big queues at the food stalls and shops. We’re in an urban area now, and I don’t even want to think what it’s like the rural areas. We’ll start moving again at first light. I don’t think anyone is going to get any sleep tonight.

Naderev Saño - also known as Yeb - has announced that he will fast until a "meaningful outcome is in sight".
"We can fix this. We can stop this madness. Right now, right here," he told delegates at the UN climate talks in Warsaw.
Choking on his words, he said he was waiting in agony for news from relatives caught in the super-storm's path, though he was relieved to hear his brother had survived:

In the last two days he has been gathering bodies of the dead with his own two hands … I will now commence a voluntary fasting for the climate. This means I will voluntarily refrain from eating food during this [conference] until a meaningful outcome is in sight.

AP reports on the efficacy of the Philippine government's disaster management plan:

As dire forecasts poured in to predict a storm that would be among the most powerful on record, authorities prepared by evacuating people from flimsy homes along the coast to concrete structures farther inland.
Similar tactics had worked only weeks earlier when powerful Cyclone Phailin struck India's eastern shore, killing just 25 people as thousands more sheltered in government evacuation centers away from the sea.
And Vietnam appeared to have successfully evacuated some 600,000 people before a weakened Haiyan arrived there early Monday.
But Philippine officials had not anticipated the 6-metre (20-foot) storm surges that swept through Tacloban, capital of the island province of Leyte, which saw the worst of Haiyan's damage.
And while many perished in shelters, others ignored the evacuation and stayed put in their homes, either out of fear their property would fall prey to looters or because they underestimated the risk.
"I was talking to the people of Tacloban," said senior presidential aide Rene Alemendras. "They said 'we were ready for the wind. We were not ready for the water.'
"We tried our very best to warn everybody," he said. "But it was really just overwhelming, especially the storm surge."
While the storm surge proved deadly, much of the initial destruction was caused by winds blasting at 235 kilometres per hour (147 mph) that occasionally blew with speeds of up to 275 kph (170 mph), howling like jet engines.

This from Naderev Saño (see below), who's just addressed the UN climate summit in Warsaw.

To anyone who continues to deny the reality that is climate change, I dare you to get off your ivory tower and away from the comfort of you armchair.
I dare you to go to the islands of the Pacific, the islands of the Caribbean and the islands of the Indian ocean and see the impacts of rising sea levels; to the mountainous regions of the Himalayas and the Andes to see communities confronting glacial floods, to the Arctic where communities grapple with the fast dwindling polar ice caps, to the large deltas of the Mekong, the Ganges, the Amazon, and the Nile where lives and livelihoods are drowned, to the hills of Central America that confronts similar monstrous hurricanes, to the vast savannas of Africa where climate change has likewise become a matter of life and death as food and water becomes scarce.
Not to forget the massive hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico and the eastern seaboard of North America.
And if that is not enough, you may want to pay a visit to the Philippines right now.

 12.37pm GMT07:37 

AP has this heartbreaking dispatch from St Michael the Archangel, a Tacloban church that is being used as a makeshift morgue as the city stuggles to cope with its dead. It tells of how a father tried, in vain, to save his two-year-old son from the floodwaters of the typhoon:

Ten bodies have been placed on wooden pews and across a pale white floor slick with blood, debris and water. One appears to have foamed at the mouth.
One has been wrapped in a white sheet, tied to a thick green bamboo pole so that people could carry it, and placed on the floor.
One body is small, and entirely covered in a red blanket.
"This is my son," says Nestor Librando, a red-eyed, 31-year-old carpenter. "He drowned."
Librando had taken refuge in a military compound nearby by time the typhoon's storm surge poured in Friday morning.
For two hours, the water rose around him. He held his 2-year-old son in one arm, his 3-year-old son in the other.
But the torrent proved too strong, and swept the family out of the building. The water rose above Librando's head and he struggled to swim.
His younger son slipped from his hands and was immediately pulled under the water.


I found his body later, behind the house. This is the worst thing I've ever seen in my life, the worst thing I could imagine. I brought him to this chapel because there was nowhere else to take him. I wanted Jesus Christ to bless him.

My colleague John Vidal wrote this piece from the Doha climate change negotiations almost a year ago. In it, he describes how Naderev Saño, the lead negotiator of the Philippine delegation, broke down as he told the talks of the devastation caused in his country by Typhoon Bopha. 
He told John: 

We have not seen any money from the rich countries to help us to adapt. So more and more people die every year. I feel very frustrated. I was very emotional because it tears your heart out when you know your people are feeling the impact. We cannot go on like this. It cannot be a way of life that we end up running always from storms.

Worth reading in the aftermath of Haiyan.

A witness report of the moment the typhoon hit Cebu city, from commenter Kookaro:

It blew out the power, tore the metal sheeting off a nearby apartment block, flattened palm, banana and coconut trees and sent rivers of rain water down the road.
I was fortunate to be living in a relatively robust and modern concrete building. The destruction in Tacloban and Samar is near-total. A terrible tragedy for these are already some of the poorest communities in the Visayas region. That there is widespread 'looting' - or more accurately, a desperate search for food, water, shelter - is not a surprise given the situation.
Natural disasters, such as the 7.2 magnitude earthquake that struck Bohol last month and now this typhoon, can never be prevented, but they do need to be planned for - as the world continues to heat up, as the weather patterns become increasingly dynamic, so we need to be better prepared. We also need to be that much more responsible to the planet, and to each other.

 11.10am GMT06:10 

The International Rescue Committee, which is now led by the former British foreign secretary David Miliband, has kicked off a $10m appeal to help victims of the typhoon. Miliband has described the aftermath of Haiyan as a "humanitarian catastrophe that needs a global coordinated response". He adds:

We have today taken the decision to deploy emergency relief coordinators to the Philippines, with a view to deciding with the host government which of IRC's areas of expertise — from water and sanitation to education — are most needed.
There is now a serious risk of major public health outbreaks, which means that health systems need urgent reinforcement. The number of people affected or in danger is still emerging but the Philippines government has increased its estimate from 4.3 to 9.5 million people. And we know that more than 28 million people were within the storm’s path.

Our global development correspondent, Mark Tran, has been talking to Leonard Doyle, head of online communications at the International Organisation for Migration in Manila, about the challenges of co-ordinating the relief response. He told Mark:

The Philippine government is very much in control of the relief effort. It is very organised. It is in the lead so it is unlikely that you will have a scenario of every one piling in an uncoordinated way. The challenge is huge but you have a government that is coherent and which works well with donors. President Benigno Aquino is very much present, very engaged. It is a well-functioning government at multiple levels. The wild card is the sheer extent of the disaster.

Doyle said the IOM was seeking funds for two million solar radios with lights, adding:

Information is a form of aid. People without information get very distressed, they need to be informed where aid is available, where to go. That is not possible with powerlines down. Radios can be a lifesaving tool.

The US marines we mentioned earlier have begun overflying the disaster area and a senior officer has described the scene as one of "total devastation".
Speaking after a two-hour flight on Monday with Philippine forces, US Marine Brigadier General Paul Kennedy said every building and house he saw was destroyed or severely damaged.
"We saw bodies everywhere," he said. Some were floating in the water, others in a schoolyard.
He said trees were uprooted for miles around, roads were impassable and power lines were down.
"I don't know how else you can describe total devastation," Kennedy said at the airport in the badly hit Philippine city of Tacloban.
Two US Marine C-130 cargo planes were parked nearby, their engines running, unloading food and water from Manila. (Via AP)

According to AP in Beijing, Typhoon Haiyan has caused at least two deaths in China:
The typhoon's huge waves and heavy wind have torn a ship from its moorings in southern China and prevented rescue of the crew.
The cargo ship, moored on Hainan island, was driven out to sea as the typhoon swept past on Sunday.
Attempts to rescue the crew by ship, speed boat and helicopter were forced back.
The Xinhua news agency said two bodies were found on Monday; five crew members are missing.

942 confirmed dead – Philippine military

Latest offical death toll: The Philippine military says it has confirmed 942 people have died in the aftermath of Typhoon Haiyan.
Military spokesman Lt Jim Alagao said on Monday that 275 others were confirmed missing from the storm, one of the strongest on record.
The death toll is expected to rise considerably. Two provincial officials predicted on Sunday that it could reach 10,000 or more.
Disrupted transportation and communications links have made it difficult to count the dead and distribute relief goods. Destruction from the typhoon, which slammed into the central Philippines on Friday, was extensive, with debris blocking roads and trapping decomposing bodies. (Via AP)

 10.02am GMT05:02 

Here's a statement from the UN:

The Secretary-General is extremely concerned by the impact of Typhoon Haiyan, one of the largest storms to ever make landfall, which has affected some 9.5 million people in the Philippines and caused widespread destruction and displacement. The death toll appears to be rising steeply, as remote areas are reached.
The Secretary-General has spoken to H.E. Libran N. Cabactulan, the Permanent Representative of the Philippines, and offered the support of the United Nations to the people and Government of the Philippines, as they cope with the disaster.
The Secretary-General notes that the United Nations and humanitarian partners, in close coordination with local and national authorities, have quickly ramped up critical relief operations to help families in desperate need. While many communities are very difficult to reach, with roads, airports and bridges destroyed or blocked with debris, agencies have begun airlifting food, health, shelter, medical and other life-saving supplies and have deployed specialist teams and vital logistics support.
The Secretary-General thanks UN Member States for their prompt response, including bilateral funds, relief teams and civil-military support. He urges the international community to continue to show their solidarity with the people of the Philippines.
Therapeutic food supplements for children, medical kits, and water and hygiene supplies have been mobilized to support some 13,000 families in the affected areas, while food, logistics and communications equipment, and thousands of tarpaulins are being flown to the typhoon-hit areas.

My colleague Tania Branigan has this report on the pleas for help coming from the Philippines:
Around 10,000 people are feared to have died in the weekend's disaster - with the armed forces reporting a confirmed death toll of 942 as of Monday afternoon. Information is only now trickling out from previously cut-off towns.
"The situation is bad, the devastation has been significant. In some cases the devastation has been total," Secretary to the Cabinet Rene Almendras told a news conference.
"The only reason why we have no reports of casualties up to now is that communications systems ... are down," reported Colonel John Sanchez of the Armed Forces of the Philippines after posting aerial pictures of the apocalyptic scenes in Guiuan, eastern Samar, where Haiyan first made landfall.

Dr Steven Godby, an expert in disaster management at Nottingham Trent university, has this quick take on how he expects the relief effort to work:

 Despite the difficulties we have been hearing of in accessing the worst affected area, damage and needs assessment missions will be taking place by air. In addition the International Charter Space and Natural Disasters has been activated which will help provide access to satellite imagery of the region and this can be used to help assess the extent and scale of the situation on the ground even if roads and airports are closed.

International aid response

Reuters has a good round-up the current state of the international aid response to the typhoon:
• The UK announced $9.6 million (£6m) package for up to 500,000 people including temporary shelter, water, plastic sheeting and household items

The Disaster Emergency Committee (DEC), a co-operative of more than a dozen leading UK charities, is expected to launch an appeal to help alleviate the humanitarian crisis in the Philippines. 
The group of 14 NGOs, which includes the British Red Cross and Oxfam, has raised more than £1.1 billion in response to massive human tragedies.
The DEC elicited donations of more than £72 million following the 2010 floods in Pakistan, £107 million for the earthquake in Haiti and a record-breaking £392 million after a tsunami devastated much of south east Asia in 2004.

 8.28am GMT03:28 

The international development secretary has been explaining how the UK is responding to the crisis.
Justine Greening said NHS experts had been flown with shelter kits and water purification facilities to Tacloban, where 10,000 people are believed to have died after Typhoon Haiyan struck on Friday. 
The £6m British rapid response is being co-ordinated with aid agencies that already have a presence "on the ground", the minister told ITV's Daybreak. 
But organisations are being hampered by widespread devastation. Emergency workers have been restricted by blocked roads and damaged airports as they raced to deliver tents, food and medicines to eastern Leyte Province. 
Greening told the programme:

Prime Minister Cameron offered President Aquino our full support over the weekend. We have already released £6 million of support and that will go on to do two things. 
First of all, a rapid response facility. In other words, we have already got experts out there on the ground, more are flying in now and should be with them later today. 
That is focused on providing shelter kits - you saw some of the conditions people having to face at the moment.
Also this issue of water, so water purification kits, and then expert advice. We've also flown out two NHS experts, and I think what we'll now do is quickly assess the scale of the needs. 

Gareth Owen, humanitarian director for Save the Children, appeared alongside Greening to pledge his support for the mission. He said he hoped the British public would support the charity's efforts "as they always do", adding:

Save the Children has worked in the Philippines for many years and we've responded to many disasters like this, but frankly nothing on this scale. 
This is simply extraordinary in the extent of the damage. We had a team on the ground in Tacloban ahead of the storm because we had a few days to prepare there. 
They were hunkered down over the weekend, we lost contact with them and feared the worst. Thankfully, they're OK, but they are reporting 80% damage in that city alone. This is huge.

Survivors are wandering through the remains of their flattened wooden homes in the city of Tacloban, hoping to find loved ones and salvage some of their belongings, according to the Associated Press.
Residents have stripped malls, shops and homes of food, water and consumer goods. Officials said some of the looting smacked of desperation but in other cases items taken included TVs, refrigerators, Christmas trees and a treadmill. An AP reporter in the town said he saw around 400 special forces and soldiers patrolling downtown to guard against further chaos.
Bobbie Womack, a US missionary and longtime Tacloban resident, said:

We're afraid that it's going to get dangerous in town because relief goods are trickling in very slow. I know it's a massive, massive undertaking to try to feed a town of over 150,000 people. They need to bring in shiploads of food.

The president of the Philippines, Benigno Aquino III, said he was considering declaring a state of emergency or martial law in Tacloban.
A state of emergency usually includes curfews, price and food supply controls, military or police checkpoints and increased security patrols.

Cheers broke out Monday in the typhoon-devastated airport of the city of Tacloban in the Philippines when 21-year old Emily Ortega gave birth to a baby girl.
Bea Joy Sagales appeared in good health. Her birth drew applause from others in the airport and military medics who assisted in her delivery. Her mother was in an evacuation centre when the storm surge hit and flooded the city.
Ortega had to swim and cling to a post to survive before she found safety at the airport. Her husband in Manila was unaware of what has happened.

 The C-130 left Manila's Vilamor air base on Monday loaded with bottled water, generators wrapped in plastic, a forklift and two trucks.
 It was the first American relief flight to the region, where thousands are feared dead and tens of thousands more homeless as a result of Friday's typhoon.
 The flight was headed for Tacloban, a city badly hit by the storm and in desperate need of assistance.

If you haven't seen it yet, Kate Hodal's dispatch from Manila gives a vivid account of the death and destruction Haiyan brought to the Philippines:
The distance from the airport to the centre of town is just seven miles by road, but the journey can easily take six hours. To get to Tacloban, the small city in Leyte province in the Philippines that was flattened on Friday by typhoon Haiyan, you have to manoeuvre through piled-up bodies, uprooted trees, jagged pieces of debris and survivors staggering around searching for food, water and supplies.
The coastal city of 222,000 inhabitants bore the brunt of 195mph winds as the strongest storm ever recorded tore off roofs and destroyed evacuation centres.
Storm surges of up to six metres in height turned roads into rivers of sewage and seawater, landing whole ships on top of houses and obliterating bridges and roads. At least 10,000 people are thought to have died so far in Leyte province alone, with the toll expected to rise ...

Good morning and welcome to the Guardian's live coverage of Typhoon Haiyan, which has now reached Vietnam after killing thousands of people in the Philippines. The Vietnamese national weather forecast agency says Haiyan made landfall in the northern province of Quang Ninh at 5 am as a tropical storm and is moving towards southern China, where it is expected to weaken to a low depression later on Monday. No casualties or major damage have been reported. Officials in Guangxi, southern China, have advised fishermen to stay ashore and told residents to take precautions against flooding and landslides.
