How we fight poverty 

The injustice of poverty demands a powerful and practical response to address both its causes and its impact on peoples' lives.

Crisis in South Sudan 

Nearly 4 million people remain in urgent need in South Sudan following the conflict that broke out in December 2013. Over 1.9 million people have fled their homes and are displaced within the country and over 479,000 have fled to neighboring countries. We have reached more than 360,000 people with life saving essentials, but we urgently need to reach more.  





 

Crisis in Syria 

More than three years after the beginning of the conflict in Syria the war shows no sign of abating. Massive numbers of refugees have fled conflict areas and are now living in inadequate shelter within Syria or in neighboring countries.

 In the Shadow of the Storm: Getting recovery right one year after typhoon Haiyan 453.27 KB 

About this paperAuthor: Alison Kent, Oxfam Humanitarian Policy AdvisorPost date: 6 November 2014Country: PhilippinesThe scale of the destruction caused when typhoon Haiyan struck the Philippines on 8 November 2013 was staggering. The emergency response provided life-saving support to millions of people in the affected region. But the challenge now is to ensure that recovery efforts leave devastated communities better able to pursue diverse livelihoods, access safe shelter and withstand future shocks. A recovery agenda is needed that focuses on poverty reduction and is based on the strengthened capacity of local authorities and communities. This will be critical for building a better future for Haiyan’s survivors living in the shadow of the storm.
