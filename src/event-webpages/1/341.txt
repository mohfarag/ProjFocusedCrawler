6. He Was About to File for Bankruptcy
(Facebook)
Fox Tampa Bay reports that May was about to file for bankruptcy, that’s according to Abigail Taunton. Though she didn’t speculate that reason as a motive for the shooting. Speaking to the Tallahassee Democrat, Taunton said that she had given him a bungalow on her property to “help him get back on his feet.”
According to a study from Get Out of Debt, 39.71% people who declare bankruptcy are clinically depressed. 
(Facebook)
In addition to his financial trouble, he may also have been reeling from the deaths of loved ones recently. On August 2, he posted on Facebook that his Uncle Cornelius and aunts Gracie, Stella and Ada had all recently died. 

7. Prior to the Shooting He Sent Packages Across the Country

WFLA reports that packages from May were sent across the country by May. Cops don’t know exactly where the packages are going or what’s in them but investigators think that might give some clue as to why May shot three people at FSU on November 21. In the days leading up to the attack, May sent messages to friends across the country and in Mexico, to tell them to expect packages. The Associated Press reports that one package from May has been located in Texas. Another man in Virginia told ABC7 that May told him to expect a package.

8. He Once Ran Cross Country for Charity
(Facebook)
According Abigail Taunton’s interview with the Associated Press, she has known the shooter since he was 13 or 14 years old when he was living his grandmother after he had trouble with his parents. He got involved in her charity then at one point joined the Taunton children in a cross-country run. The Tallahassee Democrat reports that May ran track while he was a student FSU. 

9. May Was Regularly Pulled Over for ‘Driving While Black’

On August 19, he posted on Facebook that he has been pulled over for being black, adding, in all caps, “YOU DON’T GET MEDIA COVERAGE FOR IMPROPER POLICE CONDUCT UNLESS YOU DIE.” The post was made with an article from NPR entitled, “After A Traffic Stop, Teen Was ‘Almost Another Dead Black Male.’

10. One of the Victims Has Been Named as Nathan Scott 
(Facebook)
One of the victims has been named as electrical engineering student, Nathan Scott. He’s a native of Tallahassee. Scott was named by his roommate, Jon Bowes, in a lengthy post on Facebook:
School Shootings always seemed so far and foreign… There was a shooting last night at FSU. My roommate and landlord, Nathan, was one of the ones shot. Thankfully he was only hit in the leg so he will recover quickly. We’re all really lucky this wasn’t worse. For me this just reinforces the value of being kind to EVERYONE and trying to include people.
No-one knows the motives of this gunman yet, but I would bet it wasn’t because he felt listened to, loved, and appreciated. Emotional bruises lead to this type of shit. Anger and frustration just build up until someone pops. Be nice to the weird kids, you might save someone’s life.
According to the Tallahassee Police Department, Scott is in good condition and have been released from hospital after he was shot in the leg. 
Jason Derfuss posted these shocking pics of the books that saved his life. (Facebook)
One student, Jason Derfuss, said that he was targeted by the shooter but managed to get cover behind some book shelves. He posted about the ordeal on his Facebook page. He wrote:
Earlier tonight there was a shooting at FSU, right as I was leaving Strozier. I didn’t know this at the time, but the Shooter targeted me first. The shot I heard behind me I did not feel, nor did it hit me at all. 
He was about 5 feet from me, but he hit my books. Books one minute earlier I had checked out of the library, books that should not have stopped the bullet. But they did. 
I learned this about 3 hours after it happened, I never thought to check my bag. I assumed I wasn’t a target, I assumed I was fine. The truth is I was almost killed tonight and God intervened. I know conceptually He can do all things, but to physically witness the impossible and to be surrounded by such grace is indescribable. To God be the glory, forever and ever, Amen.
He was shot dead after he refused to surrender to cops at an access ramp just outside of the library. The Associated Press reported that the body laid there for hours while detectives studied him, close to his body lay a gray baseball cap.

That’s right, PeaceFrog.  He was really playing with fire, if he was working to protect children and Targeted Individuals.  He might have found out way too much.  You can tell this is a hot case due to all the comments attempting to distract from the real subject.  My condolences to the family and friends of Mr. Myron May.

The people that usually commit these heinous acts are isolated, socially awkward losers.  This guy was a practicing attorney helping children. Doesn’t  at all seem like the typical sicko that would want to kill random strangers for no apparent reason. I guess you just never really know whats going on in someones head.

@Aila We got another armchair expert here. That’s one of the stupidest comments I’ve ever seen. There are plenty of socially awkward people and introverts who prefer to be alone. The term loser is subjective. The common thread that ties all these shooters together is mental illness. If you had any brain cells whatsoever you would realize that mental illness does not discriminate if you are a socially awkward “loser” or if you’re highly successful and sociable. So read a fucking book before you speak you dumb cunt.

Maybe the word loser shouldn’t have been involved, however as a psychology major I can concur that she is correct. They generally are isolated individuals. That’s not to say that ALL isolated individuals are going to shoot a school but the ones who do are generally not the charismatic, get along with everyone type.

I wonder if it has something to do with him perceiving being wronged somehow, like by an ex-girlfriend or something that may have been at the library as well. I agree Aila, he doesn’t appear to be socially awkward. 
His name sounded familiar and when I saw the picture, I remembered that while he was in law school in Texas, he clerked one summer at a firm where I was already practicing. Didn’t seem socially awkward at all. 
You just never know.

He was NOT gay, in fact he was one of few respectable gentlemen left in our generation. He definitely isn’t the disrespectful douche you are, I will say that much. You will always be “that guy” though… I can just tell by your ignorant demeanor. I knew him, and PLENTY of his girlfriends who are probably better than any “piece of ass” you can pull which are probably nothing more than the trash you are…

Religion in all has been responsible for the influence of killing and death. This time it just happened to be the christian faith. Most, would say that this man took the verses from the Bible out of context, meaning he didnt understand it right, but theres no one way to understand books like that. Each person no matter what religion u have faith, are always going to have your own understanding of the religoon itself. Like Islam, most of the people within a particular religion are peaceful loving folks who devote their lives to their religion, we call these folks fundamentalist. Them you have the extremists, who in most cases will justice violence and killing in the name of their God.

It’s time people actually read the bible before so they can judge God’s love.
How can you not understand this quote by Jesus: “you know the commandments: you must not kill…” and “”Put your sword back in its place, for all who draw the sword will die by the sword”?  These are not open to interpretation, they’re easy to understand.   The latter quote was said when Jesus was being arrested unjustly. The bible is very clear on being non-violent, even to your enemies.  We are taught to bless our enemies and don’t curse them.

Unsurprisingly, Mr. May’s Facebook account suggests that he suffered mental illness. He apparently believe d that he was a ”targeted individual.”  And presumably, a victim of “gang stalking.” Mental illness is a terrible thing.

Unfortunately I know all too well about this “Gang Stalking”. It’s definitely a form of paranoid Schizophrenia. They believe 100% that they are being stalked and harassed by people and/or the government every day every where they go. They think people are planting hidden video cameras or micro phones in their homes or cars and no matter how much you try to convince them that nothing is happening they will not believe you and then become paranoid that you may be a gang stalker as well since you are not feeding into their delusions. I noticed that the paranoia would get worse when this person was under a lot of stress in his personal life. Mental illness is a very tough situation to deal with.

A nigger does not have to be black, but I’d like to point out if “a nigger” is so crazy why on just about every time I a black man go to the Grocery store, white women hit on me and some directly approach me for sex (7 times in 1 year , one even asked me , “would you come to my home and take care of my needs”  and that her husband a Marine Captain was on some field duty until the weekend) seems like they really want my DNA.  And as far as white men, wow they are bold when they see a nice looking black guy like me they wink often and smile and even once at the gym one showed me his wife and asked me if I would bone her and he would like to watch – I thought he deserved to be slapped.  I said no thanks, but I thought to myself there is a time and place for such a request if I was looking for that, but I wasn’t and such a cultural defunct white grown male to ask me that – to pimp/whore out his wife, says a lot.   
Culturally different from whites’ sigh there are so many differences between white Anglo-Saxon Protestants and Irish, Italian, Polish Jewish class – but the strength is in their like cultural cohesion.  For blacks we were forced indoctrinated into so many integrated anglo-saxon cultures and are not allowed to align ourselves even maintain our heritage – hence the jim crow laws and other issue presented by whites which thwarted blacks alignment in strength.  I think this guy was identity troubled, mentally ill maybe, but a product of an environment created by dominant social classes in America (mental illness affects all social classes).  It’s sad that all cultures do not push for a more egalitarian society like a lot of blacks I know – Mostly black men are worshiped every NFL Sunday, NBA games, TRACK meets etc…(one year I noticed every single white kid I coached for ayf pee wee football (roughly 41 kids) had a black NFL sports hero, wonder why it changes or does it? We black men are more than just athletes and sex objects – we are human really no different from white men. I think the flawed perception that blacks are low class, or culturally different/or subpar intelligence is why progress in America moves so slow, if we worked more together I think we would accomplish so much more  – take a look at some of the most significant inventions and medical feats in history – you will find that many were attributed to black and brown people – the only other significant feats imo hail from German scientist.   But things are going to change in America, the Latin culture will see too it –  they will align in numbers & strength like black American was never allowed to – their descendants will inherit and lead America!

Religious people are insane. Why? Because once you believe an imaginary god is going to give you stuff, protect you from harm, make you rich, and enhance you when you have done nothing….then you live in a magical, bizarre world in which you do not function from a level of reality. In the religious mind, there is no cause and effect. Nor does 2 + 2 = 4. The religious mind believe in religious magic….that stuff can happen to you and for you because you are blessed by god or an imaginary Jesus, or Allah. People who suffer from depression or schizophrenia should NOT be engaged in any kind of delusional behavior or thought processes and especially religion….  How preachers make their money is by promising the sick, mentally ill, and the unrealistic they can get better or live more richly by simply belief….and no action. May was a “devout” Christian….and as such he truly thought that god was going to bless him, take care of him, etc. and as he was getting ready to file bankruptcy, guess what? He did not blame his failure to succeed on himself….but others, claiming the government or other people were spying on him. I really wish that religion would be removed from this planet. It does ZERO good and makes people insane, delusional, and tells them they can live in a world where if they just believe…or mumble the right words, an imaginary god is going to fix all their problems.

Weismonger2222, i don’t know what you’ve seen or heard, but I can tell you more about Christianity.  Jesus didn’t teach that we’d get stuff, be made rich, enhance us…etc.  “Blessed are the poor” and “blessed are you who mourn” are some of the teachings of Jesus.  Jesus taught us to be humble, to think of others as more important than ourselves, to rejoice when we’re persecuted…I could go on and on.  If I’m depressed and feel like there’s no hope, Jesus is the one thing i need.  He can give hope of a better future when we go to heaven.  It’s tragic that this man seemingly took out his frustrations at the government on innocent people.  I can tell you that my pastor told us just Sunday that iff the government decides to make church income taxable, so be it.  He didn’t tell us to picket or blow something up as some people do.  We turn the other cheek and move on.  I think that’s the healthiest, non-insane, thing I’ve heard in years.

You know NOTHING and sound ignorant which you are… He grew up in a small town of less than 1,000 people in the SOUTH, I knew him personally. Religion is a dominating factor in this area, especially that town. He is not this delusional monster, in fact quite the opposite. don’t judge that which you don’t know. Personally I am not religious at all but I will say nothing about his actions are typical to who he was. He was VERY successful. He didn’t “fail to succeed” by any means, nor did he blame others for his troubles. He practiced law in 2 states TX & NM and was about to take the bar in FL. Sorry but that’s not failure, know your facts bro. He didn’t expect God to “fix” all his problems rather he held the typical religious beliefs he grew up on. He was a kind and gentle spirit, the guy who was loved by everyone he came in contact with. Success can come at a costly price, in this case – sanity. I think medication plays a part, it definitely induced paranoia. Conspiracies are out there and obviously became an obsession of his but nobody knows why he suddenly consumed himself in that. However I am not here to argue with you but I knew him for who he really was. I grew up with him. You know nothing about him yet you speak for him. I never respond to these things on any subject matter but this incident has lit some fire in me and to see the hate thrown his way by people who are mere strangers is disheartening. I hate what he did, but I love who he was. I wish I had told him how much of an impact he had on my life growing up and how much it meant to me that 15+ years later he made it a point to stay in touch. Even more I wish he had the support he gave to everyone around him. I will not remember him for this…

All good points, but he didn’t go to a place of worship with a weapon, he went BACK TO SCHOOL, and they were ready for him. What came first, his religious beliefs or his mental
disorder(s)? Seems as though he aimed his wrath at FSU, he was disappointed with his educational outcome, perhaps he felt deceived by the promises made about higher ed.
and found the reality wanting.

Not smart enough to have self discipline.  Actions speak louder than words.

Seems to me we should be looking up and reading about “TARGETED INDIVIDUALS, “electronic harassment” rather than “Monday morning quarterbacking” here. Those subjects have come up several times [ex. Aaron Alexis]. There is obviously something to this–remember Edward Snowden and what he said. It’s so easy to say someone has a “mental condition.”  Hey, mind-control is a “mental condition.”  Remember MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE? He was, as I remember, a mind-controlled victim, “sleeper cell,” with a “mental condition.”

I’m not entertaining IGNORANT comments made by those who didn’t know him. He was one of the most gentle souls I’ve ever known. He was not gay, not even close. He was not socially awkward, he was loved by many. He was the guy who could make you laugh at your lowest of times. He talked me of the ledge so to speak, not literally but he was there at my lowest points. I’ve known him sense childhood, he was one of a handful that stayed in touch over the years. That’s just who he was. He was a great athlete, great with children, over-achiever, super successful and he seemed to love life. Unfortunately, “SEEMED” is the keyword. I don’t condone what he did but that is NOT at all how I will remember him. He is not this monster that people make him out to be. I am a psych grad – I KNOW what medication can do to people. I don’t know if meds are to blame but everything I see is not him at all. He is from a super small town of under 1,000 people in the South where religion obviously dominates – as the stereotypes suggest. So his religious messages are not some variable leading up to the shooting. My last contact with him was only a month ago where he asked about my child and me and life… he had nothing but positive things to say about his own life. I wish I had talked more personally… Dont demonize or judge what you don’t know. Myron is near and dear to my heart and one of my most remembered childhood friends – you never know what someone is going thru. He is not the typical case of a shooter. When I heard this I checked a million times for misspelling, mistaken identity, until I saw a picture of his lifeless body on the concrete. This makes even myself look at these incidents in a different light. I will not engage in argument nor will I entertain ignorance. I will say those who love him deserve to grieve in peace…

You fools–can’t you see this “black guy” is an innocent fall guy.   Wake up!  You are being brainwashed again.  I’ve seen this tactic time and time again.   Show evidence of a mass shooting of people killed, injured and scared.  And then plaster the face of the fall guy.   The public falls for it every time.  You fall for it because of the heinousness and enormity of the crime.  This blinds you to the fact that “fall guy” could be innocent.  The public needs the instant gratification of focusing their anger on a target and these authorities provided one right away.  It should amaze all of you how they know SO MUCH about his background and etc. so quickly.  He was a target individual.   He believe in Christ and God.  
There is no God.   There can’t be.  A real God would never allow an innocent people to be blamed and killed for something they didn’t do-repeatedly.    This is not the America you think it is.  
This guy  was put on a “target list”, probably by someone he once worked for or did business with.

This is another case of government brainwashing programs gone wrong. The shooter was stalked, slandered and character assassinated because of his political opinions. The media labels such people as mentally ill to discredit them. In Canada, there is a similar program in place that targets activists, conspiracy theorists and any “extremist”. Note the “extremist” in quote is defined as anyone who protests peacefully according to the rights outlined in the charter of rights and freedoms.

Religion let Myron down. And it can let you down too, with loads of screwy, feeble, magical answers!

Religion will let you down.  You’ll be surprised to know that Christianity is not a religion though.  Christianity actually frees you, whereas religion binds.  Jesus came to free us from sin.  Think of it this way:  to a lot of people, alcohol controls their life.  They are a slave to the bottle.  You can say the same about drugs, sex, crime, etc.  When Jesus came, he died for all of our sin.  Now, we don’t have to be slaves to sin any more.  We can follow Jesus, who is God’s word, and be free from that which binds us.

The article mentions that one of his friends says a medication was causing him to experience paranoia. That combined with both the truthful and the sensationalistic material on mind control and on electronic harassment could seemingly very easily cause one to become convinced that he or she is a T.I. while not actually being targeted. 
I am aware as to how many of the unthinking, irrational sheep are likely to respond to this, but I am in fact an actual targeted individual, and the reality is that there is no need to believe in mind control, as its existence has even been confirmed by The Science Channel. Apparently the overwhelming majority of those who are very keen on anything the “scientific community” vomits in their direction somehow overlooked it: https://vimeo.com/83959037 
If he intended to kill innocent people for the sake of alleviating whatever he was experiencing then he definitely does not fit the definition of a targeted individual any more than did Aaron Alexis. 
T.I.s experience suffering which no one amongst the general public could ever comprehend, and we are aware of that because we once were among the members of the general public leading ordinary lives. We know whereof we speak when we state that what we experience every day of our lives is such that even the horrors of the Holocaust cannot come close to comparing. 
Despite this perpetual hell, owing to our character and personal inner strength, T.I.s do not lash out violently against anyone. 
There are targeted individuals who are in their eighties and have been subject to electronic harassment for upwards of thirty or forty years, not in prison, not in a mental health facility, but among the populous, and the fact that you are unaware of their existence speaks volumes as to their ability to endure the greatest horrors ever experienced and not to take it out on anyone whereas the vast multitudes of animal street trash respond to near infinitely lesser misfortune and abuses by heartlessly victimizing innocents in tremendous numbers every day.
