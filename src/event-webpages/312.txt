At least 10 people have been killed and more than 30 wounded in what authorities described as a mortar bomb explosion on a bus in the southern Philippines.
The rural bus was passing near the main gate of Central Mindanao University in Maramag town, Bukidnon province, on Tuesday night when a powerful blast sent shrapnel and debris flying through the vehicle, said town safety officer Alejandro Navarro.
It was thought a mortar concealed in a bag went off in an overheard rack, Navarro said.
Investigators were searching for other possible devices in Maramag, about 535 miles (860km) south-east of Manila, said police officer Rufina Bayarcal.
Ralph Quilla, a 17-year-old student who was riding on the bus, said the explosion occurred at the back of the vehicle and wounded him in the arm. “There was a loud explosion that filled the bus with smoke,” Quilla said from a hospital where he and other victims were taken for treatment. “I saw bloodied people and jumped out of a window.”
Islamist rebels and extortion gangs have been blamed for past bombings on buses in the country’s south.
The attacks have continued despite a state of high alert for military and police forces in the south because of sporadic bombings and other attacks by hardline Islamist insurgents opposed to a new autonomy deal between the government and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front, the largest Muslim rebel group in the country.
