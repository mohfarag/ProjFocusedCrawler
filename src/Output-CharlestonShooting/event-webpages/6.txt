CHARLESTON, S.C. --
 Police were searching for a suspect after a gunman opened fire Wednesday night at a church in downtown Charleston, 
CBS affiliate WCSC-TV reported
.
Charleston police spokesman Charles Francis said the shooting took place around 9 p.m. at the Emanuel AME Church on Calhoun Street, as a meeting was taking place.
Nine people died in the shooting, authorities say.
Charleston PD Chief Greg Mullen said, "I do believe it was a hate crime."
A few hours after the shooting, authorities began clearing the area after a bomb threat was called in to police dispatchers.
An Associated Press reporter on the scene says police helicopters with searchlights circled overhead in the area, as a group of pastors prayed across the street.
Francis described the suspect as a clean-shaven white male with a slim build, approximately 21 years old, who was wearing a gray sweatshirt, jeans, and boots.
The Emmanuel AME church is a historic African-American church that traces its roots to 1816, when several churches split from Charleston's Methodist Episcopal church.	
One of its founders, Denmark Vesey, tried to organize a slave revolt in 1822. He was caught, and white landowners had his church burned in revenge. Parishioners worshiped underground until after the Civil War.
This is a developing story.

This is a tragedy! I’ve never understood the motivation behind all these wackos that feel the need to get some notoriety by killing others. I can’t help wondering how being detained and questioned will affect the life of that photographer who just happened to be wearing the wrong outfit!  It shouldn’t, but you know that tons of people will see him in handcuffs but not read far enough to see that he was released!  Here’s an interesting article about the pastor that was killed…

Maybe this has been discussed already. I haven’t caught up with the story here yet or all the comments on all threads. Just curious: Any crime scene photos yet? What about the report that 30 of the shooter’s 80-something friends on Facebook are black? Isn’t that curious for a racist?
