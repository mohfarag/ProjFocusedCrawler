Charleston church shooting gunman threatened to kill a week earlier - but no one took him seriously

Friends of Dylann Storm Roof - who slaughtered nine black churchgoers - failed to take his threats seriously because of his deadpan sense of humour

Dylann Storm Roof


 A gunman who slaughtered nine black churchgoers in a hate-filled rampage told pals he wanted to kill people a week before the massacre But tragically, no one took Dylann Storm Roof's threats seriously because of his deadpan sense of humor. The 21-year-old's friend Christon Scriven, who is black, said: “He flat out told us he was going to do this stuff.” Last Wednesday — exactly one week before the Charleston church shooting — Roof said “he was looking to kill a bunch of people,” Scriven said.

 The friends assumed Roof, known for his dry sense of humor, was joking. “He’s weird. You don’t know when to take him seriously and when not to,” said Scriven. Roof stormed the church in Charleston, South Carolina, and ranted at his victims: “You rape our women and you’re taking over our country. And you have to go.” The killer spared one woman to “tell the world what happened” as he shot a pastor and eight members of a bible study group.

Hateful: Wearing flags of apartheid era on Facebook


 Roof – pictured on his Facebook page with the flags of apartheid-era South Africa and Rhodesia on his jacket – was caught yesterday by traffic police 245 miles away after 14 hours on the run. One witness told how Roof – who was given a .45 calibre pistol by his father for his birthday two months ago – remained “as cold as ice” as he killed six women and three men. Among the first to be shot was the pastor, Reverend Clementa Pinckney, 41, who was also a state senator. Roof opened fire after sitting through the one-hour prayer meeting next to Reverend Pinckney , whom he had asked for on arrival at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church. Eight people died at the scene and one died in hospital. Three survivors were taken to hospital. The victims were tonight named as mum-of-three Sharonda Coleman-Singleton, 45; Librarian Cynthia Hurd, 54; University graduate Tywanza Sanders, 26; Myra Thompson, 59, was wife to Reverend Anthony Thompson. Also killed were church janitor Ethel Lance, 70; her cousin Susie Jackson, 87; Reverend Daniel L. Simmons, 74; and mum-of-four DePayne Middleton, 49.

One female survivor told how Roof reloaded five times and at one point was spoken to by the son of a churchgoer who tried to “talk him out of doing the act of killing people”. An elderly woman told her granddaughter to play dead when he started firing. Reverend Pinckney’s cousin Sylvia Johnson said: “At the conclusion of the Bible study they just start hearing loud noises ringing out and he’d already been wounded. The suspect already wounded a couple of individuals.” Another cousin, Kent Williams, said: “It’s a huge, huge loss. A sad, sad thing that has happened.”

 US President Barack Obama, who said he and wife Michelle knew Reverend Pinckney, expressed his fury over the killings, saying that such horrific incidents of gun violence do not happen in other advanced countries. Charleston mayor Joe Riley said the killer was motivated by hate, adding: “It’s the most dastardly act one could possibly imagine, and we will bring that person to justice. This is one hateful person.” Roof offered no resistance when he was arrested in Shelby, North Carolina yesterday after a member of the public spotted his car and alerted police. His family were being quizzed by police hoping for clues as to why he may have carried out the killing. Uncle Carson Cowles described him as a “quiet, soft-spoken” boy .

 Roof was previously arrested on April 26 on a trespassing charge and before that on March 3 for possession of a controlled substance. Ex-schoolmate John Mullins described him as “kind of wild”. He added: “He used drugs heavily…harder than marijuana. He was a pill popper, from what I understood – Xanax, stuff like that.” A hate crime probe has been launched into the shooting at the church, which has a predominantly black congregation. Charleston Police Chief Gregory Mullen said: “We believe this is a hate crime. That is how we are investigating it. The tragedy we’re addressing right now is indescribable. “No one in this community will ever forget this night. We are committed to do whatever is ­necessary to bring this individual to justice. We are not leaving any stone unturned.” A possible bomb threat was investigated after the killings but the all-clear was given after several hours. Officials were looking into whether it was timed to coincide with two large political rallies in the city.   Rev Pinckney met presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton as part of her campaign just hours before he was killed. Mrs Clinton tweeted: “Heartbreaking news from Charleston – my thoughts and prayers are with you all.” Republican Jeb Bush was also due to visit ­Charleston yesterday but his appearance was cancelled. In a statement, the Bush campaign said: “Governor Bush’s thoughts and prayers are with individuals and families affected by this tragedy.” More than 30,000 people are killed by guns each year in America, where some 310 million firearms are estimated to be owned by residents. Laws on sale and purchase vary from state to state but in South Carolina no permit is needed to possess rifles, shotguns and handguns, which can be bought in high-street stores. Loaded weapons are also allowed to be carried in a console or glove compartment of a car. But some restrictions do exist. It is illegal to possess automatic guns, machine guns, sawn-off shotguns and rifles, or to carry a loaded weapon on to private or public school property or into any publicly owned building without permission. The death penalty still exists in the state.
