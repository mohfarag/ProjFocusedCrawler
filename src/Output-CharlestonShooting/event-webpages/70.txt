Dylann Roof: the cold stare of a killer with a history of drug abuse and racism









A picture has emerged of the 21-year-old man captured after allegedly killing nine black churchgoers: withdrawn to the woods – and potentially racist

It was the menacing stare that horrified the world; it was the flags on his jacket that began to paint the portrait of a suspected mass killer.
The Facebook profile picture of 21-year-old Dylann Storm Roof quickly emerged as a defining image of the aftermath in the shooting spree he is now accused of orchestrating, as it became clear the mop-topped man caught in surveillance footage at a South Carolina church was the same as the one in the jacket in the woods.

On one patch of the jacket, the flag of white-ruled Rhodesia, the African country that became Zimbabwe in 1980. 
On the patch above: a flag from apartheid-era South Africa.

Richard Cohen, the president of the Southern Poverty Law Center, said Roof was not known to his organization, which tracks hate crimes across the US, but based on his Facebook page he appeared to be a “disaffected white supremacist”.
Based on interviews with friends and family, plus a mixed educational record and a criminal record, a fuller picture was quickly forming of the man accused of shooting and killing nine people on Wednesday in Charleston, South Carolina.
He is an introvert, but Roof also appears to have a history of racism and drug abuse – and a family that reportedly gave him a gun as a gift.

Roof fled the church in his Hyundai sedan – with Confederate flag license plates – and was captured in Shelby, North Carolina, more than 240 miles away. Police pulled over Roof’s car after a tip from the public described the vehicle as suspicious. Police believe he was the lone assailant and described him as “cooperative” during the traffic stop. 
Pinckney’s cousin Sylvia Johnson told NBC News a survivor of the mass killing had told her Roof said he “had to” keep shooting, as another churchgoer attempted to talk him out of firing his weapon while he reloaded.
“He just said, ‘I have to do it,’” she said. “‘You rape our women, and you’re taking over our country, and you have to go,’” she said.

Roof’s family members described the 21-year-old, who apparently received a .45-caliber pistol for his 21st birthday, as introverted. Roof’s uncle Carson Cowles told his sister, Roof’s mother, that the young man was overly withdrawn, Reuters reported. 
“I said he was like 19 years old, he still didn’t have a job, a driver’s license or anything like that and he just stayed in his room a lot of the time,” Cowles said. 
“I don’t have any words for it. Nobody in my family had seen anything like this coming,” he said. “I said, if it is him, and when they catch him, he’s got to pay for this.”
Joey Meek, one of Roof’s childhood friends, said he alerted the FBI after recognising him in a surveillance camera image that was widely circulated by law enforcement agencies early on Thursday, Meek’s mother, Kimberly Konzny, told the Associated Press. Roof had worn the same sweatshirt while playing Xbox videogames in their home recently, she said.
“I don’t know what was going through his head,” Konzny said. “He was a really sweet kid. He was quiet. He only had a few friends.”
A high-school contemporary, John Mullins, told the Daily Beast that the young Roof had been “kind of wild”. 
“He used drugs heavily a lot,” Mullins said. “It was obviously harder than marijuana. He was like a pill popper, from what I understood. Like Xanax, and stuff like that.”
He added: “He made a lot of racist jokes, but you don’t really take them seriously like that. You don’t really think of it like that.” But now, he said, it seemed that “the things he said were kind of not joking”. 
Another acquaintance said Roof had had black friends at school. “I never thought he’d do something like this,” said Antonio Metze, 19. “He had black friends.”

Though police say Roof lived in Columbia, South Carolina, he apparently had ties to the nearby Lexington area. Roof had a mixed educational record in the Lexington school district, attending White Knoll high school in both the 2008-09 and 2009-10 school years. He repeated ninth grade both years, but was pulled and re-enrolled more than once. He also attended White Knoll elementary school for fourth grade in 2003-04.
The Lexington school district said it was unable to find annual photos of Roof, and that it has no records of other schools he might have attended.
Roof also had at least two run-ins with the law. The Lexington County district attorney’s office confirmed that Roof was charged with possession of a controlled substance in a 2 March incident, but the circumstances surrounding that arrest remain unclear. 
He was also arrested in April for misdemeanor trespassing in Lexington County.

On Thursday, police released Roof’s mugshot and then moved him from police custody in North Carolina, on his way back to face charges in South Carolina.
Reuters reports that Roof lived with his older sister Amber and their father part-time, until his father and stepmother divorced. A profile on TheKnot.com shows that Amber Roof is scheduled to be married Sunday in Lexington, South Carolina, Reuters reported.
The social media picture of the man also remains murky. 
A picture widely circulated in the media from a Facebook account identified as Dylann Roof shows him wearing a black jacket adorned with two flags associated with white supremacy: that of apartheid-era South Africa, and that of Rhodesia, the white-ruled country that later became Zimbabwe , scowling in front of a swamp.
A number of his Facebook friends are black. There is little more personally identifying information on the page.
The profile has not been independently confirmed by the Guardian, and media reports indicate that law enforcement may not be aware of the account.

It’s unclear what other social media Roof may have used – at least one Instagram profile with Roof’s name and likeness exists, but is locked as a private user.
