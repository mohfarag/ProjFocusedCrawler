There are constants in the small towns of Western Oregon, some waning, some enduring. In Douglas County — the home of Umpqua Community College, 
 — two of those constants are trees and the right to bear arms
. 
 
Umpqua is surrounded by nearly three million acres of commercial forests. Those forests supply the local economy with one-tenth of its jobs — a rarity in a state where timber employment has cratered  — and they loom large in the area’s support for gun rights.
 
Young men and women there grow up to work the woods and the lumber mills, and they learn to hunt the woods for birds and big game. The county of 107,000 is a conservative place, where Mitt Romney thumped President Obama 62 percent to 35 percent, and where elected officials have time and again raised their voices against proposed gun control.
 
In 2013, after a man killed 20 children and 6 adults with a rifle at a school in Newtown, Conn., the sheriff of Douglas County sent a letter to Vice President Joe Biden, at a time when the Obama administration was pushing for a law to expand federal background checks for gun purchases.
 
The sheriff, John Hanlin, 
 he was making “a formal request that you NOT tamper with or attempt to amend the 2nd Amendment” – and vowing not to enforce any such law that violated the constitution.
 
“Gun control,” he added, “is NOT the answer to preventing heinous crimes like school shootings."
 
Congress passed no such law. When Oregon lawmakers were considering their own background check expansion bill this year, Douglas County leaders recoiled again, even before the Democratic-controlled legislature could send it to the governor.
 
At a 
 in February, county commissioners approved a resolution "objecting to any expansion of Oregon's failed 'background-check' system for firearms transfers between qualified, law-abiding persons.”
 
The bill passed over their objections, and Gov. Kate Brown, a Democrat, signed it.
 
(As it happened, the bill’s author, State Sen. Floyd Prozanski, represents part of Roseburg, a town of 22,200 where the shooting took place, though he hails from the much more liberal Eugene area. Douglas County is closer to California border than liberal Portland.)
 
 
 
 
 
That legislation made Oregon one of the first states to adopt the blanket background checks that have been pushed by a national gun-control group funded by former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg. Those checks apply to almost any transfer of a gun between two people who aren’t related to one another, and not just to sales at shops and gun shows.
 
Until that point, Oregon put relatively few restrictions on gun ownership, compared to other states. A right to bear arms is enshrined in the state constitution. No state license is required to buy a gun. It is a “shall-issue” state for concealed weapons permits, meaning applicants only need to satisfy certain criteria – like not having any outsanding warrants for their arrest – and not demonstrated a need to carry a gun concealed.
 
The background checks law was a step in a different direction. And to some in large swaths of rural Oregon — and vast expanses of America — it can feel like a betrayal of their way of life.
 
A lot of folks in the Western Oregon timber towns, such as Roseburg, already blame the government for chopping off their timber economy in the 
 of the early 1990s. Since then, Oregon’s wood-products industry has crashed. Roseburg has held out longer than most timber towns, but it, too, is facing the harsh realities of economic transition. The average pay has dropped well below what it was in the 1980s.

Portland has bounced back since the end of the Great Recession. Most of the rest of the state hasn’t. Unemployment remains above eight percent in Roseburg, well above the state and national levels. “It’s a rural area,” says Brian Rooney, a regional economist who studies Douglas County for the Oregon Employment Department. “There’s a lot of seasonal employment. If you lose a job in a rural area, it takes longer to find a job.”
 
Some new industries have arisen in Douglas County. In several cases – boat manufacturers, winemakers – those employers have teamed up with Umpqua Community College to train students to do the work they need to grow and thrive.
 
For so many young people in Douglas County, and across Western Oregon, the community college has become an opportunity for a job in a new economy. A new constant, for a changing time.
