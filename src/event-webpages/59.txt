Typhoon Haiyan survivors in Tacloban face upheaval as city tries to rebuild









Suitable shelter remains scarce six months after storm, and no-build zones may force fishing families to leave seafront

When typhoon Haiyan ripped up Jaime Boctot's home and killed 14 members of his family, he would not be moved. The 60-year-old fisherman simply rebuilt the house in the same location, metres from the sea.
But six months after the strongest storm ever to make landfall turned the Philippine city of Tacloban upside down, Boctot may now have to find somewhere new. Tacloban knows it has to build back better to resist future storms, and part of that strategy involves an embargo on building near the seafront.
"My life has been spent near the sea," Boctot said. "I have worked as a diver all my life. I don't know what to do if that is taken away from me."
Thousands of families are living in areas designated as no-build zones. Officials estimate that under the new rules, 200,000 people may need to be resettled – another major upheaval for those who rebuilt using scrap materials and donations from NGOs.
Pamalakaya, a locally formed fishermen's alliance, has rallied against the policy, saying it would destroy their only form of livelihood.
Permanent, suitable shelter remains one of the biggest problems for Tacloban residents. More than 52,000 families are living in tents in danger zones while officials try to put together a £450m fund for temporary and permanent shelters.







The social welfare department has transferred 3,455 families to 265 bunkhouses across the region and provided shelter support to 571,206 households.
In village number 89, along the coast from Tacloban, Nimpha and Rolando Bachao, both 65, live in a grimy tent provided by the UNHCR. "This is not a very good life. My husband has had two strokes since he got here and has hardly received any medical attention. As the weather gets hotter, it's almost unbearable in our tents," said Nimpha Bachao, swatting away flies.
Other survivors who initially took shelter in Tacloban's astrodome during the typhoon were moved to nearby bunkhouses two months ago. These bunkhouses received widespread criticism from humanitarian groups who found the facilities too cramped and the construction material substandard. Each plywood house is made up of 24 units, with a common bathroom and kitchen shared between them.
Compared with conditions in the evacuation centres, some residents are happy with their new shelter. "I don't mind living here. It is a bit hot, but I like it more than the evacuation centres, which were dirty, crowded and dangerous," said Jovyll Pillejera, 33, who lives with his wife and daughter.
There are plans to relocate families who live in no-build zones to the northern part of Tacloban City. The mayor, Alfred Romualdez, and the Tacloban Recovery and Sustainable Development Group (TRSDG), have drawn up blueprints for a 100-hectare community to house the homeless.
"In the masterplan you will see that the relocation site was chosen because there was no hazard, no storm surge or tsunami, landslide or flooding. It's prime land," said Romualdez.
The main obstacle is acquiring sufficient land and funding. The government has 30 to 40 hectares and needs another 30 to 70, which will cost the best part of £1m. Another £10m will be needed to develop the area.
The houses will be constructed using funds from NGOs and private donors including Habitat for Humanity, Operation Blessing and Operation Compassion.
"Right now we are fast-tracking the first phase, which is 10 hectares. The commitment of the buildings and contractors are this December," Romualdez said. By then, many people will have lived in temporary dwellings for more than a year.
