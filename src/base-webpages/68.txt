Disaster Alert: Typhoon Hagupit (Ruby) Approaches the Philippines

Typhoon Hagupit (locally known as Ruby) has gained strength in the western Pacific and is projected to intensify further as it heads towards the Philippines. If the storm makes landfall, it will pose a serious threat to lives, homes and livelihoods. It is possible that it will cross through highly populated areas and affect millions of people—including the Visayas region which was hit by Typhoon Haiyan in November 2013. The typhoon could also also impact the Central Luzon and Mindanao regions of the country.
The Red Cross is taking emergency preparedness measures as the storm approaches. Philippine Red Cross disaster response teams and volunteers are ready to support evacuations in high-risk areas if necessary. Additional staff and volunteers across all areas are on high alert. In Tacloban, the local Red Cross is ready to provide first aid support and has pre-positioned teams throughout the city. Relief items such as food, sleeping mats and hygiene kits are being prepared. Emergency equipment—including water trucks, generators, chainsaws and communications gear—is ready for use in areas that may be impacted by the storm.
The global Red Cross network in the Philippines is ready to respond to the worst-case scenario and has pre-positioned supplies for up to 30,000 families in Manila, Cebu and Subic, including blankets, sleeping mats, bed sheets, jerry cans and mosquito nets.

Announcement
We will be changing our Disaster Online Newsroom format in the upcoming weeks (we will be rolling everything into a new webpage/format that will be easier to read/search).  As part of the transition, we will be doing a weekly update (on Fridays) that will recap what disasters we're responding to across the country.  Additionally, we will be posting any time sensitive disaster updates from our chapters.  As part of the transition to our new Disaster format, we will not be regularly posting images or stories from the field - you can find those at .
