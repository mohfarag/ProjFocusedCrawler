Despite Weakening, Hagupit to Inundate Vietnam

A brief overview of the weather across Asia is given in the above AccuWeather.com video.

Despite no longer being the powerful typhoon that devastated the Philippines, Hagupit will still threaten Vietnam with flooding rain.
Hagupit is now a tropical depression and dramatically weaker than when it was approaching the Philippines as a super typhoon.
Interaction with Philippines' numerous islands, some of which are very mountainous, contributed to the weakening.
While Hagupit is no longer a monster and is expected to weaken further, flooding rain will still target central and southern Vietnam into the start of the weekend.

Hagupit will reach the coast of southern Vietnam early Friday, but a surge of tropical moisture will prolong the stream of drenching rain onto the Vietnamese coast from Quy Nhon to Phan Rang through Saturday.
"Rainfall amounts of 75-150 mm (3-6 inches) Friday and Friday night and another 15 to 40 mm (0.50-1.50 inches) on Saturday will mean that flooding is a serious concern," stated AccuWeather.com Meteorologist Evan Duffey.

Some of these same areas experienced torrential rainfall only a week ago from Tropical Cyclone Sinlaku, which will further elevate the threat for flooding and mudslides.
"Sunday and Monday will finally see activity settle down across southern Vietnam, if even for only a short while," Duffey stated.
Another tropical disturbance may bring another round of downpours to this same area early next week.
AccuWeather.com Meteorologists Andy Mussoline and Kristina Pydynowski contributed to this story.
