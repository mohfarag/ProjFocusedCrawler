        COMMENTEMAILMORECENTENNIAL, Colo. – Jurors on Thursday got a close-up look at bullet holes left in the walls of the Aurora movie theater where 12 people were killed in 2012.A crime-scene investigator showed jurors sections of the walls removed from the theater. Jurors have already seen theater seats that were damaged in the shooting.James Holmes faces the death penalty in connection with the July 20, 2012, shooting that also injured 70 people.Also on Thursday, a witness explained the use of caltrops, or defensive stars, which are devices used to puncture car tires. Prosecutors have suggested Holmes bought them to throw out the window of his car during an escape.Shooting victim Carli Richards also showed jurors images of her injuries. Richards, who credited her stint in the Navy with helping her recognize the tear gas thrown into the theater that night, was hit by shotgun pellets and sold them online to raise money to pay her bills.Prosecutors argue Holmes is a highly intelligent young man who secretly plotted the attack for months as his professional and personal life unraveled. Defense attorneys say Holmes suffers from schizophrenia and was delusional, and that his mental illness prompted him to plan and execute the shooting without understanding that what he was doing was wrong.The trial is in its third week, and is expected to last another four months.Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1HjS04M
