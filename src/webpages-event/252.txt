(Charlottesville Police/Charlottesville Police)   By T. Rees Shapiro September 16  Follow @TReesShapiro     [Update: Police canvas Charlottesville for missing teen from Fairfax County]  The search continued Tuesday for a missing University of Virginia student with ties to the Washington area, and her family said it would be unusual for her to go this long without having any contact with her family and friends. Hannah Graham, 18, was last seen early Saturday morning after reportedly spending the night socializing with friends in Charlottesville. A 2013 graduate of Fairfax County’s West Potomac High School, Graham is a sophomore at U-Va., where she is a member of the ski team. “Since learning of Hannah’s disappearance, we have been heartbroken and at the same time heartened by the outpouring of support and help we have received,” Graham’s family said in a statement Tuesday. “We remain hopeful that Hannah will be found soon.” Police said that Graham last communicated with friends by text message at 1:20 a.m. She was reported missing about 4:30 p.m. Sunday. Charlottesville police Capt. Gary Pleasants told Richmond CBS affiliate WTVR that Graham was seen on surveillance footage outside of McGrady’s Irish Pub at 12:45 a.m. Saturday and that police had expanded the search area in the neighborhoods nearby, east of the U-Va. campus. According to WTVR, police said Graham was “fairly well intoxicated” that night. Her father, John, her mother, Susan, and brother James said in a statement that Graham’s disappearance is unusual behavior for a woman known for being organized and responsible: “She would not disappear without contacting family or friends.” The Grahams said that their daughter embraces “life with energy and enthusiasm and has enriched the lives of many. Her empathy is evident in her daily interactions with us and her friends.” They asked anyone with information about their daughter’s whereabouts to contact a dedicated tip line at 434-295-3851.  T.
