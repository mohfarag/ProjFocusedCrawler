Florida State's Jimbo Fisher football camp begins Wednesday, and this is the recruiting event Florida State fans have been waiting for. The Seminoles are looking to sign about 24-27 players in the class (27 only if they have studs beating down their door).
As we saw with the last camp, FSU is being very selective and stingy with some offers. Having a "road" game at Miami in front of many South Florida recruits, and the uncertainty swirling in Gainesville, may yield opportunities for FSU to be in a position to grab some players it otherwise would not have landed. It needs to have spots open later in the year and not be in a position which forces it to tell numerous commits to look elsewhere.





Tuesday, I previewed the offensive recruiting visiting Tallahassee for the Jimbo Fisher football camp. Tonight, I'll look at some of the headliners on defense. If you have questions about players not mentioned, please do ask.
Defensive line
FSU is looking to bring in at least four defensive linemen (two tackles and two ends, minimum). It already holds a commitment from elite South Carolina defensive end Michael Barnett.
The huge news of the week, now being reported by most major outlets, is that Virginia five-star defensive end Josh Sweat, the kid many consider to be the best player in the country, will be visiting Tallahassee this week. That is a huge deal, obviously. (h/t VT;s 247 site, originally, for the scoop).
Underclassmen: 2016 defensive end Janarius Robinson, of Panama City, is also expected in. He was bummed out about missing the June camp, he told me. He holds an FSU offer.
I have to imagine that FSU will be bringing in a top DT prospect or two, but I didn't hear back from a few who I figured might be coming. Luckily, these guys are easy to spot!





I expect FSU to take a JUCO at the tackle position this cycle.
Linebacker
FSU has met its need of two linebackers in the class with Brian Bell (of Georgia, and expected to come down for the camp) and Sh'Mar Kilby-Lane. It would take a third if the player was an elite of the elite, but none of that caliber for the 2015 class expected this week.
However, 2017 megastar Dylan Moses, of Louisiana, is coming. Moses is an LSU commit, and looks like a college sophomore. He is the first player Scout.com ever rated as a five-star 40 months before he can sign his papers. Obviously, an LSU commit in LSU's back yard will be incredibly tough to pull, but with so much time between now and his eventual signing, FSU has to try in case anything happens.
Defensive back
FSU needs to take at least five defensive backs in its class, and it will likely take more. Right now, it has four committed: Derwin James (Haines City), Calvin Brewton (Miami Central), A.J. Westbrook (Daytona Mainland) and Tyrek Cole (Miramar). James is the best safety in the country by a wide margin, Brewton is a versatile DB who can play safety and corner, Westbrook is a player with very good length and the likely ability to play corner, and Cole is a tremendous cover corner who many don't consider all that committed to FSU at all (with Miami and WVU, for very different reasons, being the deciding factors). I expect James, Brewton and Westbrook to be in town.
FSU is in the middle of an incredible run of putting defensive backs in the NFL draft that will likely peak during the upcoming draft, and that has a ton of defensive backs interested.
In June, Texas CB Kris Boyd came in for an extended visit and FSU has a real chance with him. Now, four-star CB Holton Hill, also of Texas, will be in town for an extended visit. Credit Tim Brewster for some excellent recruiting in the area.
CB Davante Davis, of Miami (Fla.) Booker T (transfer from Homestead) will be in town. He has a big-time offer list that includes all of the Florida schools, Georgia, Alabama and a few others across the country.
Underclassmen: Pompano Beach (Fla.) Coconut Creek's Trayvon Mullen is a superstar cornerback at 6'2 and he'll be up for the camp. He  will eventually hold all the major national offers, and I'd expect FSU to offer this week if he shows well. J.J. Givens camped at Virginia Tech earlier in the week and earned an offer. He'll be at FSU this week, too. I am excited to see him play.
Not coming: CB Iman Marshall (California 5-star) told me that he will not be visiting FSU for an unofficial or camp because of the distance, but that he does plan to take a visit. It was previously speculated that he would be visiting.  CB Tarvarus McFadden, of Ft. Lauderdale American Heritage, told me at Nike's The Opening that he was unsure whether he would visit for the camp. I spoke with him Tuesday night and he said that he will not be visiting anywhere this week.
Being that this is the state of Florida, AKA the land of the defensive backs, I'd be shocked if more star secondary players don't show up.
Updates will begin around noon in a separate article Wednesday.
