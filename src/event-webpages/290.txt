The Philippine Commonwealth Era
 
The Commonwealth era 
is the 10 year transitional period in Philippine history from 1935 to 1945 in 
preparation for independence from the United States as provided for under the 
Philippine Independence Act or more popularly known as the
Tydings-McDuffie 
Law. 
The 
Commonwealth era was interrupted when the Japanese occupied the Philippines in January 2, 1942. The Commonwealth government, 
lead by Manuel L. Quezon and Sergio 
S. Osmeña went into exile in the U.S., Quezon died of tuberculosis while in exile and Osmeña 
took over as president. At the same time, the Japanese forces installed a 
puppet government in Manila headed by Jose P. Laurel as president. This government is 
known as the Second Philippine Republic. On October 20, 1944, the Allied forces 
led by Gen. Douglas MacArthur landed on the island of Leyte to liberate the 
Philippines from the Japanese. Japan formally surrendered in September 2, 1945.
 
After liberation, the Commonwealth government was restored. 
Congress convened in its first regular 
session on July 9, 1945. It was the first time the people’s representatives have assembled since their election on 
November 11, 1941. Manuel Roxas was elected Senate President, and
Elpidio Quirino was chosen President 
Pro Tempore. Jose Zulueta was speaker of the house, while Prospero Sanidad 
became speaker pro Tempore. The first law of this congress, enacted as 
commonwealth act 672, organized the central bank of the Philippines. The 
commonwealth deal also tackled the issue of collaboration. In September 1945 the 
counter intelligence corps presented the people who were accused of having 
collaborated with, or given aid to, the Japanese. Included were prominent 
Filipinos who had been active in the puppet government that the Japanese had 
been established. ”A Peoples Court" was created to investigate and decide on the 
issue. 

Amidst this sad state of affairs, the third commonwealth elections were held on 
April 23, 1946. Sergio Osmeña and Manuel Roxas vied for the Presidency. Roxas 
won thus becoming the last president of the Philippine Commonwealth. The Commonwealth era formally ended when the 
United States granted independence to the Philippines, 
as scheduled on July 4, 1946.
 
Important legislations 
and events during the American period that made the Philippines a commonwealth 
of the United States: 
 
The Philippine Bill 
of 1902 - Cooper Act
 
United States Congressman Henry Allen Cooper 
sponsored the Philippine Bill of 1902, also known as the Cooper Act. The bill proposed the creation and 
administration of a civil government in the Philippines. 
President Theodore Roosevelt signed 
it into law in July 2, 1902.
 
Here are some of the more important provisions 
of the Cooper Act:
 
▪ Ratification of all 
changes introduced in the Philippine government by the president of the U.S., such 
as the establishment of the Philippine Commission, the office of the civil 
governor and the Supreme court
▪ Extension of the 
American Bill of Rights to the Filipinos except the right of trial by jury
▪ Creation of 
bicameral legislative body, with the Philippine Commission as the upper house 
and a still-to-be-elected Philippine Assembly as the Lower House
▪ Retention of the 
executive powers of the civil governor, who was also president of the Philippine Commission
▪ Designation of the Philippine Commission as the 
legislating authority for non-Christian tribes
▪ Retention of the Judicial powers of the Supreme court and other lower courts
▪ Appointment of two Filipino resident commissioners who would represent the Philippines in the US Congress but would not enjoy voting rights
▪ Conservation of Philippine natural resources
 
The bill contained 3 provisions that had to be fulfilled first before the Philippine Assembly could be establishing these were the:
 
▪ Complete restoration of peace and order in the Philippines
▪ Accomplishment of a Nationwide census
▪ Two years of peace and order after the publication of the census
 

The Philippine Assembly
 
The assembly was 
inaugurated on October 16, 1907 at the Manila Grand Opera House, with US 
secretary of War William Howard Taft 
as guest of honor. Sergio Osmeña was elected Speaker while Manuel Quezon was elected Majority Floor leader. 
The Recognition of the Philippine Assembly paved the way for the establishment of the bicameral 
Philippine Legislature. The Assembly functioned as the lower House, while the Philippine Commission served 
as the upper house.
 
Resident 
Commissioners
 
Benito Legarda and Pablo Ocampo 
were the first commissioners. Other Filipinos who occupied this position included Manuel Quezon, 
Jaime de Veyra, Teodoro Yangco, Isaro Gabaldon, and Camilo Osias.
 
The Jones Law
 
To further train the 
Filipinos in the art of government, the U.S. Congress enacted 
the Jones Law on August 29, 1916. It was the first official document that clearly promised the 
Philippine independence, as stated in its preamble, as soon as a stable government was established. 
The Jones Law or the Philippine Autonomy act, Replace the Philippine bill of 1902 as the framework 
of the Philippine government. It provide for the creation of the executive powers. The vice 
governor general, assisted by his Cabinet, would exercise executive powers. The vice governor 
would act concurrently as the Secretary of Education.
 

Creation 
of the Council of State
 
Upon the recommendation 
of Manuel L. Quezon and 
Sergio Osmeña, 
Governor General Francis Burton Harrison issued an executive order on October 16, 1981, 
creating the first Council of State in the Philippines. It was the Council’s duty to 
advise the governor general on matters such as the creation of policies for 
administering government offices. 
 
The Council held 
meetings once a week and whenever the governor general called for one. It was 
composed of the governor general, the department secretaries, the speaker of the 
Lower House, and the Senate president. During Harrison’s term, the executive 
and legislative branches of government worked harmoniously with each other.
 
The Os-Rox Mission
 
One delegation, however, that met 
with partial success was the Os-Rox Mission, so called because it was headed by Sergio Osmeña 
and Manuel Roxas. The Os-Rox group went to the United States in 1931 and was able to influence 
the U.S. Congress to pass a pro-independence bill by Representative Butter Hare, Senator Henry Hawes, 
and Senator Bronso Cutting. The Hare-Hawes-Cutting Law provided for a 10-year transition period before 
the United States would recognize Philippine independence. U.S. 
President Herbert Hoover did 
not sign the bill; but both Houses of Congress ratified it. When the Os-Rox Mission presented 
the Hare-Hawes-Cutting Law to the Philippine Legislature, it was rejected by a the 
American High Commissioner representing the US president in the country and the 
Philippine Senate, 
specifically the provision that gave the U.S. president the right to maintain land 
and other properties reserved for military use. Manuel Quezon was tasked to head 
another independence mission to the united States.
 
The Tydings-McDuffie Law

In December 1933, Manuel L. Quezon returned to the Philippines from the United 
States with a slightly amended version of the Hare-Hawes-Cutting bill authored 
by Senator Milliard Tydings and representative McDuffie. President
Franklin Delano Roosevelt, the 
new U.S. president, signed it into law on March 24, 1934. The Tydings-McDuffie Act 
(officially the Philippine Independence Act of the United States Congress; 
Public Law 73-127) or more popularly known as the The Tydings-McDuffie Law 
provided for the establishment of the Commonwealth government for a period of 
ten years preparatory to the granting of Independence.
