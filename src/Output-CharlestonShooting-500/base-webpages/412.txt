 • Charleston church shooting: what we know so far  • Gunman kills nine people at Charleston church: 3 men, 6 women • Charleston mayor condemns shooting as 'hate crime'  • FBI & police hunt suspect; photo released of white man, early 20s • 3 survivors; female victim spared 'to tell everyone what happened' • Clementa Pinckney, state senator, and sister among victims  Latest  17.35  Barack Obama is giving a speech right now condemning the 'senseless murders' and has urged a national reckoning on gun violence.  He said he felt anger and heartache over the murders.  17.00  Peter Foster, our US Editor in Washington writes:   Jaime Harrison, the chairman of the South Carolina Democratic Party and a close friend of Clementa Pinckney, a local senator who was among the nine dead, has told The Telegraph that it is time America addressed the toxic combination of deep racial hatreds and the widespread availability of guns.   "This was a tragic, but also a terrorist act. If the reports are correct about the things he said in the church and his intentions, there is no more perfect example of a hate crime. It was methodical and he had time to premeditate it, and even decide not to do it.   "It was cold, calculating and we as a nation have to do something to stop this. When racism and this infatuation with giving folks guns, starts to invade us in our churches, when it comes into God’s house, then is enough is enough."  16.55  The suspect was "cooperative" when a police officer stopped him at a traffic stop after a member of the public spotted the car.  Police believe the suspect acted alone, says police chief Mullan.   We don't have any reason to believe there was anyone else involved.  16.51  Mayor Joseph Riley says he has received calls from Joe Biden, the US vice-president who knew victim Clementa Pinckney personally, and Barack Obama, who "conveyed his sympathy and for the people of America to let us know they were with us."   That awful person. That terrible human being who would go into a place of worship where people were playing and kill them is now in custody where he will always remain."  In this great country we hold sacred the places where people come and practice their faiths in safety and in peace. So the arrest of this man is important for us in the community and in this country to begin the process of healing together.  It's a wonderful sign that in America we don't let bad people like this get away with these dastardly deeds.  16.42  Charleston police chief Greg Mullan is holding a press conference:   I am very pleased to say... we have arrested Dylan Roof   He was arrested in Shelby, NC at a traffic stop.   We have detectives preparing to fly to Shelby to interview and prepapre for evidence recovery.  16.40  Loretta Lynch, the US Attorney General, has spoken briefly on the Charleston shooting at the start of her press conference. She confirmed a suspect is in custody.

 President Barack Obama is due to speak on the matter shortly, while a vigil will start for the victims in 20 minutes.  16.22  CNN, MSNBC and CBS are also now reporting that suspect Dylann Roof has been caught and is in custody

 16.19  Local reports claim the suspect has been caught.  According to Meg Rivers, a producer at WLTX News1, he has been caught in Shelby, in North Carolina, just across the border from South Carolina and a four hour drive from Charleston.  She tweeted the information with this picture:

 15.25  Carson Cowles, suspect Dylann Roof's uncle, has told Reuters his nephew was a "quiet, soft spoken" person.  The gun he received as a 21st birthday present, and is thought to have used in the shooting, was a .45 calibre pistol.  15.20  Roof is shown wearing a jacket bearing the flags of apartheid-era South Africa and white minority rule Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe)   15.18  Suspect Dylann Roof was arrested for trespassing on April 26, 2015.  He had previously been jailed on March 1, also in South Carolina's Lexington County, on a drug charge, according to the Post & Courier.   15.13  Police are at the home of Dylann Roof's mother, his uncle has told Reuters.  Roof received the gun he is believed to have used in the shooting as a birthday present just two months ago, the uncle said.  The uncle recognised Roof from the surveillance images circulated earlier by police.  "The more I look at him, the more I'm convinced, that's him," said Carson Cowles, 56, in a phone interview.

 15.07  The FBI have named the shooter as Dylann Roof, 21, from near Columbia, the largest city and state capital of South Carolina.  15.04  The twisted words of the shooter as he murdered his nine victims have emerged.  The gunman told his victims he "had to kill them" because "You rape our women and you're taking over our country", according to the cousin of victim Rev Clementa Pinckney, who had spoken to one of the female survivors.  In an interview with NBC, Sylvia Johnson said:   From my understanding the suspect came to the church and he asked for the pastor.   They showed him where the pastor was. He sat next to my cousin, Rev Clementa Pinckney, throughout the entire bible study.   At the conclusion of the bible study, from what I understand, they just start hearing a loud noise, it's just ringing out, and the suspect had already wounded a couple of indidivuals including my cousin Rev Clementa Pinckney.   [One of the survivors] said he [the suspect] had reloaded five different times, and her son was trying to tlak him out of doing the act of killing people. And he just said "I have to do it... You rape our women and you're taking over our country, and you have to go".  14.16  Reuters has compiled a list of the condolences from presidential candidates including Ben Carson, a retired brain surgeon and political newcomer running for the Republican nomination, who said on Facebook:   Last night, evil walked the streets of Charleston. My heart aches for the families of the victims. I pray for the families left behind. I pray for the community scared and hurting. I also pray you and I can conquer hatred."   (Laura Segall/Getty Images)   13.50   The US justice department's civil rights division and the FBI will lead a federal hate crimes investigation into the shootings, a department spokesman said. The hunt for the suspected gunman continues.  13.09  The latest photos show the suspect entering the church at 8.16pm - just under an hour before the police recieved an emergency call alerting them to the shooting.  During that interim, we have now learnt, the suspect was sat with the prayer group he was shortly to open fire upon, killing nine.  According to AFP, he is wearing "some sort of black cloth or satchel hanging from underneath the front of his sweater, and what appears to be a strap over his right shoulder", though it is not clear from the photos what exactly the item is. 


 12.44  Three more photos of the suspect have been released by officials:

 12.20  The police chief is asked how his forces are coping with the strains of the all-night hunt.   Thank you for asking that question. [The officers] are tired but they are energised.   They take this personal... someone coming to our city, going to a church, sitting down with people who are praying... and murdering them.   We are going to get through it. We are going to keep pushing.  12.17  There were three survivors from the shooting.  12.15  The individual sat in the church with the prayer group for "almost an hour" before the shooting, says police chief Greg Mullan.

 12.12  Police chief Greg Mullan is now taking questions. He says identifying the victims is a job for the coroner's office, and offers no more names.  He says police have no specific information about the gunman's current whereabouts.  12.10  Charleston's mayor Joseph Riley is now speaking. He descibes the shooting as "beyond incomprehensible" and an "unspeakable act", but says "we can catch this no-good, horrible person, and see that he pays the price".  He says the Charleston community will pull together to provide aid and support for the victims' families.  12.08  Greg Mullan, Charleston police chief, ends with a plea to the media and social media users to spread the images of the suspect to help to bring him into custody as soon as possible:   This tragedy that we're addressing right now is indescribable. No-one from this community will ever forget this night... Because of the pain and hurt this individual has caused this community, this entire communtiy, the law enforcement agencies working on this are comitted and we will catch this individual.   12.05   This is a situation that is unacceptable in any society and especially in our society and our city.   We are bringing in officers from the FBI in Washington and have set up a hotline.   This is a very dangerous individual - he should not be approached. We do not want more people being harmed trying to approach him or trying to follow the vehicle.

 12.03  Police chief Greg Mullan has begun by recapping the events from last night. They were alerted at 9.05pm.  Only one victim was ever taken to the hospital, where that person died. Reports of a second injured victim were inaccurate.  Three males and six females were killed.  12.02  The press conference is about to begin.  12.01  A help centre for victims' families has been set up in Charleston, reports the city's Post and Courier:   A family assistance center has been established for families of the victims at the Embassy Suites Hotel, according to a release from the City of Charleston. The center will be staffed by local, state and federal victim services personnel and the Charleston Coastal Chaplaincy.   11.51  The sister of Rev Clementa Pickney was also killed in the shooting, the New York Times reports, citing J. Todd Rutherford, the South Carolina Democrat who is minority leader of the State House of Representatives.  11.45  The main press conference is due to take place in 15 minutes, at 7.00am local time

 11.21  Greg Mullan, the Charleston chief of police, has asked for the community's help in tracking the suspect, who has been filmed on surveillance video and is between 21 and 25 years old:   We want everyone to be vigilant, we want them if they see anything suspicious to call us.   This is an all hands on deck effort with the community as well as law enforcement.    11.18  The Charleston police are speaking to the press specifically on the suspect, ahead of the 7.00am press conference   We've got a good starting point, a good suspect... we need the assistance of the public... Do not approach this person, call 911.   We have no reason to believe he's not in the Charleston area. He could be outside.   We believe this was a hate crime, that's how we're investigating it.  11.05  A picture of the suspect has been published by Charleston's local government on its Facebook page. He is "considered armed and dangerous". He left the church in a black four-door sedan car, also pictured.

 09.59  Dr Norvel Goff, a senior African Methodist Episcopal pastor, has given this description of the shooting after meeting families and the mayor:   He [the gunman] walked in, from my understanding, not so much as a participant but a brief observer, who then stood up and started shooting.

 09.27  A female survivor has given a harrowing account of the shooting, as recounted by NAACP president Dot Scott to Charleston's main newspaper, the Post and Courier:   A female survivor told family members that the gunman initially sat down in the church for a bit before standing up and opening fire, according to Dot Scott, president of the Charleston NAACP.   The gunman reportedly told the woman he was letting her live so she could tell everyone else what happened, Scott said.

 09.12  A five-year-old child was in the church at the time of the shooting survived by playing dead, according to family members who were briefed by chaplains about the shooting, ABC News reports.  09.07  Details have emerged of the "imminent" threat that caused police to move members of the media back away from the site soon after the shooting - a bomb threat was made.  Charleston County Sheriff's Office spokesman Eric Watson said a bomb threat was reported near the church. People who were gathered in the area were told by police to move back.  However, police chief Gregory Mullen has since said that the all-clear has been given after checks.  08.42am  The only identified victim so far is Rev Clementa Pickney, 41, a state senator and pastor who was thought to have been attending the bible study group attacked by the gunman.   Mr Pickney was heavily involved in the community response to the death of Walter Scott, the black man shot in the back by a white policeman from North Charleston as he ran away. The incident, caught on camera, sparked mass protests.  Mr Pickney led a prayer vigil attended by Al Sharpton.  He subsequently co-sponsored this bill in the state senate requiring police to wear "body-worn cameras" - a bill recently signed into law by the state governor.  Mr Pickney had long been a prominent member of South Carolina's political community, having joined the state legislature aged 23 (the youngest African-American ever to do so) and the state senate at 27. He had a wife, Jennifer, and two children - Eliana and Malana.  South Carolina senator Tim Scott tweeted his condolences for Mr Pickney: 

Heart is breaking for Charleston and South Carolina. My prayers are with Emanuel AME and Pastor Pinckney.— Tim Scott (@SenatorTimScott)

Tonight we stand in prayer for Pastor Pinckney and his congregation, and the families who are enduring unimaginable pain at their loss.— Tim Scott (@SenatorTimScott) 
  June 18, 2015
 According to some reports, Mr Pickney's sister was at the scene of the shooting and may have been among those injured or killed.  08.22am  Although the gunman's motives are not yet known, many are speculating that the attack was motivated by race.  Charleston's mayor has already referred to the incident as a hate crime. It is being investigated as such. Some have gone further.  Tory Fields, a member of the Charleston County Ministers Conference, told the New York Times:   It’s obvious that it’s race. What else could it be? You’ve got a white guy going into an African-American church. That’s choice. He chose to go into that church and harm those people. That’s choice.   8.12am  Nikki Haley, the governor of South Carolina, has released the following statement:   Michael, Rena, Nalin and I are praying for the victims and families touched by tonight's senseless tragedy at Emanuel AME Church. While we do not yet know all of the details, we do know that we'll never understand what motivates anyone to enter one of our places of worship and take the life of another. Please join us in lifting up the victims and their families with our love and prayers.

 8.01am  Agents from the FBI, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division and other agencies are assisting the investigation.  Police chief Greg Mullen said the police were tracking the suspect with police dogs. He said:   Obviously, this is the worst night of my career. This is clearly a tragedy in the city of Charleston  A man matching the police description (see 7.47) was arrested earlier at around 10.45pm local time, but police later said the hunt for the gunman was ongoing.   A man kneels across the street from where police gather outside the Emanuel AME Church (AP)  7.56am  Hillary Clinton and Jeb Bush both had presidential campaign events planned in the area, and have tweeted to express their sympathies.  Mr Bush has cancelled his planned events, while Mrs Clinton is believed to have already left the Charleston area when the shooting took place.

 7.47am  Charleston police are searching for the gunman, described as a "a w/m [white male], approx 21 [years old], slender, small build, wearing a grey sweat shirt, blue jeans, timberland boots, clean shaven", but have not yet asked anyone to evacuate their homes in the area.

 However, police have moved members of the media back away from the site due to what they called an "imminent" threat. They did not release any details.  7.42am  Charleston's mayor Joseph P. Riley:   The only reason that someone could walk into a church and shoot people praying is out of hate   It is the most dastardly act that one could possibly imagine, and we will bring that person to justice. ... This is one hateful person.  This is the most unspeakable and heart-breaking tragedy.   People [were] in prayer on a Wednesday evening. A ritual coming together, praying and worshipping God. To have an awful person come in and shoot them is, is inexplicable.  7.22am 


 7.19am  Charleston is known locally as "The Holy City," due to its large number of churches and historical mix of immigrant ethnic groups that brought a variety of creeds to the southern city on the Atlantic coast.

  7.15am (All times BST)  The website for the Emanuel AME Church says it has one of the largest and oldest black congregations in the South. It has its roots in the early 19th century, and the current building was built in 1891. It is considered a historically significant building, according to the National Park Service.  7.11am BST  Following the attack on the church, Republican presidential candidate Jeb Bush, the former governor of Florida, cancelled an appearance in Charleston that had been scheduled for Thursday morning.  "Governor Bush's thoughts and prayers are with the individuals and families affected by this tragedy," his campaign team said in a statement.   Jeb Bush waves on stage as he announces his candidacy (GETTY)  7.10am BST  None of the victims were immediately identified. But the Reverend Al Sharpton, the New York-based civil rights leader, said in a Tweet that the Reverend Clementa Pinckney, the church's pastor and a member of the state Senate, was among the fatalities.

 7.09am BST  Eight victims were found dead in the Emanuel AME Church, Chief Gregory Mullen told reporters at a media conference, and a ninth person died after being taken to a hospital. One other person was wounded and receiving treatment.  Mr Mullen said: "It is unfathomable that somebody in today's society would walk into a church when people are having a prayer meeting and take their lives."  7.02am BST  Thomas Dixon, a local pastor, told CNN: "It's really bad. It's a very bad scene.  "Apparently the person just entered the church and opened fire.  "That part has not been fully articulated on what happened yet ... they are still looking for the suspect."   The steeple of Emanuel AME Church is visible as police close off a section of Calhoun Street (AP)  6.45am BST  The suspect, who police described as a 21-year-old white man wearing a sweatshirt, jeans and boots, was still at large hours after the shooting on Wednesday evening.

 6.30am BST  A white gunman burst into a historically black church in Charleston, South Carolina last night and massacred nine people during a bible study group.  The gunman remains on the loose and police were last night hunting across the city for him. Police are saying it appears to be a hate crime and the FBI are rushing in from Washington.   This man waits for news of family members who were inside the church at the time of the shooting (AP)  Among the dead is reportedly a South Carolina state senator.  Jeb Bush was supposed to be campaigning in the area but has cancelled all his events in the wake of the shooting.   Police pictured at the scene (Reuters//Randall Hill)
