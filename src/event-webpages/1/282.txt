The cows dry, trees stunted, no more flowers, no more purity, ambition, corruption, the age of Kali, the black time."

 Unless we put medical freedom into the Constitution the time will comee when medicine will organize itself into an undercover dictatorship. To restrict the art of healing to doctors and deny equal privileges to others will constitute the Bastille of medical science. All such laws are un-American and despotic. 
Benjamin Rush, Signer of the Declaration of Independence
Destiny comes to those who listen and fate finds the rest. 
Frederick Nietzsche who said (I am paraphrasing) that to get to a semblance of truth, one must start by throwing out everything the theologians want to pass off as truth!
Believe those who are seeking the truth. Doubt those who find it. ~Andre Gide
If you chase two rabbits you will not catch either one. Russian
John Swinton on the Free Press 
One night, probably in 1880, John Swinton, then the preeminent New York journalist, was the guest of honour at a banquet given him by the leaders of his craft. Someone who knew neither the press nor Swinton offered a toast to the independent press. Swinton outraged his colleagues by replying:
“There is no such thing, at this date of the world’s history, in America, as an independent press. You know it and I know it.
There is not one of you who dares to write your honest opinions, and if you did, you know beforehand that it would never appear in print. I am paid weekly for keeping my honest opinion out of the paper I am connected with.
Others of you are paid similar salaries for similar things, and any of you who would be so foolish as to write honest opinions would be out on the streets looking for another job. If I allowed my honest opinions to appear in one issue of my paper, before twenty-four hours my occupation would be gone.
The business of the journalists is to destroy the truth, to lie outright, to pervert, to vilify, to fawn at the feet of mammon, and to sell his country and his race for his daily bread. You know it and I know it, and what folly is this toasting an independent press?
We are the tools and vassals of rich men behind the scenes. We are the jumping jacks, they pull the strings and we dance. Our talents, our possibilities and our lives are all the property of other men. We are intellectual prostitutes.”
I believe that men are generally still a little afraid of the dark, though the witches are all hung, and Christianity and candles have been introduced. ~Henry David Thoreau, "Solitude," Walden, 1854
The angels have grown tired of the clever .... Kahlil Gibran
Some people walk in the rain others just get wet.
A member of the Ohiyesa Santee Sioux was asked about the sabbath and he replied that he saw no need to set aside one day a week for God, for an indian all days are God's days. 
“Sometimes people hold a core belief that is very strong. When they are presented with evidence that works against that belief, the new evidence cannot be accepted. It would create a feeling that is extremely uncomfortable, called cognitive dissonance. And because it is so important to protect the core belief, they will rationalize, ignore and even deny anything that doesn’t fit in with the core belief.” -Frantz Fanon”
It is much easier to fool someone than to to convince them they have been fooled ... Mark Twain
I usually lump organized religion, organized labor, and organized crime together. The Mafia gets points for having the best restaurants.
Faith is spiritualized imagination
To me faith means not worrying. ~John Dewey
“The real hopeless victims of mental illness are to be found among those who appear to be most normal. "Many of them are normal because they are so well adjusted to our mode of existence, because their human voice has been silenced so early in their lives, that they do not even struggle or suffer or develop symptoms as the neurotic does." They are normal not in what may be called the absolute sense of the word; they are normal only in relation to a profoundly abnormal society. Their perfect adjustment to that abnormal society is a measure of their mental sickness. These millions of abnormally normal people, living without fuss in a society to which, if they were fully human beings, they ought not to be adjusted.”
Aldous Huxley Brave New World

 



 An Inuit hunter asked the local missionary priest: "If I did not know about God and sin, would I go to hell?" "No," said the priest, "not if you did not know." "Then why," asked the Inuit earnestly, "did you tell me?" ~Annie Dillard, Pilgrim at Tinker Creek.
I didn't know I had a quarrel with him. ~Henry Thoreau in answer to the question, "Have you made your peace with God?"
Man is a Religious Animal. He is the only Religious Animal. He is the only animal that has the True Religion - several of them. He is the only animal that loves his neighbor as himself and cuts his throat if his theology isn't straight. He has made a graveyard of the globe in trying his honest best to smooth his brother's path to happiness and heaven. ~Mark Twain
Religion is regarded by the common people as true, by the wise as false, and by the rulers as useful. ~Seneca the Younger
The past actually happened but history is only what someone wrote down. ~A. Whitney Brown, The Big Picture
Woe unto the defeated,
whom history treads
into the dust.
~Arthur Koestler, Darkness at Noon
 "Beware of the pedant, the man in the ivory tower, who cannot be trusted any more than the rabble of the streets.  Too long cloistered in the halls of academe, the first are dangerous, for they fail to understand the world, and know not reality. The second are like a mindless storm, roaring and insatiable, full of rage, and a self righteous and acquisitive passion Cicero
All things are subject to interpretation whichever interpretation prevails at a given time is a function of power and not truth.......Nietzsche
He who fights with monsters might take care lest he thereby become a monster. And if you gaze long into the abyss, the abyss gazes also into you....Nietzsche
How good bad music and bad reason sound when one marches against an enemy...Nietzsche
Whatever is done for love always occurs beyond good and evil......Nietzsche
In heaven all the interesting people are missing.....Nietzsche
The kingdom of heaven is a condition of the heart..not something that comes upon the earth or after death.....Nietzsche
We should consider everyday lost which we do not dance at least once.....Nietzsche
Against boredom the gods themselves fight in vain.....Nietzsche
You can see a lot by just looking
Who is more foolish, the child afraid of the dark or the man afraid of the light?
“The real hopeless victims of mental illness are to be found among those who appear to be most normal.

These millions of abnormally normal people, living without fuss in a society to which, if they were fully human beings, they ought not to be adjusted.” -Aldous Huxley, Brave New World Revisited
Scriptures: the sacred books of our holy religion, as distinguished from the false and profane writings on which all other faiths are based. ~Ambrose Bierce
The question before the human race is, whether the God of nature shall govern the world by his own laws, or whether priests and kings shall rule it by fictitious miracles? ~John Adams, letter to Thomas Jefferson, 20 June 1815
— H.L. Mencken, The Baltimore Evening Sun, July 26, 1920
“Democracy is the theory that the common people know what they want, and deserve to get it good and hard.”
Democracy too is a religion. It is the worship of jackals by jackasses.
“As democracy is perfected, the office of the President represents, more and more closely, the inner soul of the people. On some great and glorious day, the plain folks of the land will reach their heart’s desire at last and the White House will be occupied by a downright fool and complete narcissistic moron.”
1920

 



 I viewed my fellow man not as a fallen angel, but as a risen ape. ~Desmond Morris, The Naked Ape...
The study of crime begins with the knowledge of oneself. ~Henry Miller, The Air-Conditioned Nightmare, 1945.....
There is great security in the prisons we create for ourselves. ~Stephen G. Scalese, The Whisper in Your Heart.......
And remember, no matter where you go, there you are. ~Confucius........
There are at least two kinds of cowards. One kind always lives with himself, afraid to face the world. The other kind lives with the world, afraid to face himself........
It is not easy to find happiness in ourselves, and it is not possible to find it elsewhere. ~Agnes Repplier.......
Never be afraid to sit awhile and think. ~Lorraine Hansberry, A Raisin in the Sun.......
It's not what you look at that matters, it's what you see. ~Henry David Thoreau.......
History is a vast early warning system. ~Norman Cousins........
There's more to the truth than just the facts. ~Author Unknown.........
If a man who cannot count finds a four-leaf clover, is he lucky?
~Stanislaw J. Lec.......
To repeat what others have said requires education, to challenge it requires brains. Mary Pettibone Poule..........Glass eye in a keyhole.......
Insanity in individuals is something rare..but in groups, parties, nations, and epochs it is the rule....Nietzsche........
Occident: The part of the world lying west (or east) of the Orient. It is largely inhabited by Christians, a powerful subtribe of the Hypocrites, whose principal industries are murder and cheating, which they are pleased to call "war" and "commerce." These, also, are the principal industries of the Orient. ~Ambrose Bierce, The Devil's Dictionary.........
"There are days when you need someone who just wants to be your sunshine and not the air you breathe.".........
We would rather forgive the evil proliferating all around us than the rebellion against it, which we mistake for the true evil - Arno Gruen (Betrayal of the Self)........
For animals earth is hell, and men are the demons who torture them...Arthur Schopenhauer........
History records no conflict greater or more long enduring than that of humanity against the truth ~ Brendan Gil.......
Those who represent an ideal beyond the comprehension of the masses must face the persecution of the unthinking multitude who are without the divine idealism which inspires progress and those rational faculties which unerringly sift truth from falsehood." -Manly Palmer Hall..........
If you cannot be a student of logic, at least be a casual fan........
“To know when one does not know is best. To think one knows when one does not know is a dire disease.” Taoism: Tao Te Ching
“The fool who knows that he is a fool is for that very reason a wise man; the fool who thinks he is wise is called a fool indeed.” Buddhism: Dhammapada
The indian does not understand why the Christian sets aside one day as the sabbath-To the indian all days are God's days ... Santee Sioux
Rodney Alcala, Ted Bundy, Wm Gacy, Son of Sam, Jeffrey Dahmer, Lenin, Marx, The Windsors, Trotsky and Victor Rothschild all have one thing in common and if you don't know what it is, I suggest you find out as soon as possible!
Our race is the Master Race. We are divine gods on this planet. We are as different from the inferior races as they are from insects. In fact, compared to our race, other races are beasts and animals, cattle at best. Other races are considered as human excrement. Our destiny is to rule over the inferior races. Our earthly kingdom will be ruled by our leader with a rod of iron. The masses will lick our feet and serve us as our slaves."
-Menachem Begin (Israeli Prime Minister, 1977-1983)
