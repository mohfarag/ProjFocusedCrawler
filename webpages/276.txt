Recently, floods unleashed havoc in northern Burkina Faso, rendering thousands of people homeless in Gorom-Gorom. A missionary blogger, Keith Smith who’s been working for over a decade among Fulanis in the arid region, quickly mobilised support for the victims. He now gives an update of the effort that was to successfully forestall humanitarian disaster and says, “our first food aid distribution was completed on Friday, and was a success, thanks to the hard work, forethought, and effectiveness of our team on the ground.”
