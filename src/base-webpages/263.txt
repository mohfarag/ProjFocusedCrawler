WEATHER forecasters had given warning before Typhoon Haiyan struck the Philippines that the storm was extraordinarily powerful. That it was extraordinarily destructive became clear to all when the typhoon landed on the east coast November 8th. Three days later it has become apparent that the storm was also extraordinarily deadly; the survivors will require an colossal relief effort just to stay alive.Before the typhoon landed, meteorologists had detected wind speeds of 313kph (194mph) near the centre, gusting up to 378kph, making it one of the strongest storms ever recorded. It whipped up giant waves that crashed ashore. Between them, the wind and waves ploughed through coastal communities, crushing buildings as if they were cardboard, tossing boats and cars around like toys and sweeping people to their deaths. The storm charged across the middle of country from east to west, drenching everything in its path with driving rain. Homes and crops that the wind failed to destroy were left at the mercy of flooding and landslides brought on by the rain.A picture of the amount of death and destruction caused began to emerge only after the storm had swept out over the South China Sea, heading towards Vietnam. Witnesses spoke of corpses littering the wrecked city of Tacloban, on the east coast, which felt the full force of the storm. They spoke of dazed survivors wandering streets strewn with debris, begging for help. “From the shore and moving a kilometre inland, there are no structures standing. It was like a tsunami,” said the interior secretary, Manuel Roxas, after inspecting the destruction from a helicopter. “I don't know how to describe what I saw.”

The responsible authorities were powerless to find out the extent of the disaster, let alone bring relief. In Tacloban and elsewhere, the electricity supply, the water supply and telephone communications were among the first casualties. The local authorities were unable to help survivors as public servants were unable to report for duty. Fallen trees and power lines had blocked roads and floods had swept away bridges. More out-of-the-way places were beyond help.In the lull between the shock of the storm and the reaction to it, there was an air of desperation. The government sent police reinforcements to Tacloban in response to reports of looting. In some places, the dead were buried in mass graves. Local officials began making wild guesses that many thousands had been killed in their districts.The guesses might turn out to be correct. But three days after Haiyan struck, the government’s National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council was certain only that the storm had killed 229 people and injured 45—displacing 630,000 and otherwise disrupting the lives of 9.5m. A huge international effort to shelter and feed the survivors and treat the ill and injured is still taking shape. The Philippines is accustomed to tropical cyclones. About 20 pass over or near it each year. As Typhoon Haiyan approached, tens of thousands of people in its path followed the ordinary drill: leaving their homes and sheltering in public buildings regarded as being storm-proof. But tens of thousands more clearly failed to follow the drill. People tend to be reluctant to leave their homes or businesses in times of emergency, for fear of looters. Typhoons rarely hit the central and southern Philippines, and people there tend not to take storm warnings as seriously as do the storm-hardened peoples of northern Luzon island.So in the centre of the country ordinary disaster risk-reduction and management measures have proven themselves unequal to challenges posed on an extraordinary scale. Ordinary warning measures were insufficient to rouse many people to abandon their homes and now it turns out that the disaster-relief agencies lack the resources they would need to tend to the damage that has been done.

Your words are as vivid as photographs of this sad event in my country. You have described it succinctly from approach to departure of the typhoon.
I don't know if I am straying off the topic, but when they were showing preparations by my countrymen for the approaching storm, the people were only lashing thin nylon ropes and putting rubber tires and rocks on their  corrugated iron roofs; the winds were being estimated at 200 plus k/h. I thought, how poor Filipinos are. Their houses are of bamboo and nipa leaves. And as they line up for meager relief, I see a young pregnant woman, with an infant slung on her hip, several children are peering from behind her. I believe that the elites of my country have failed the people.

My sympathies with Filipino people and I pray they overcome this disaster.
I wish if Philippines would have invested in weather forecasting and space research like India in last 40 years.
Last month there was level 5 cyclone Phalin on eastern cost of India and some 1 million people were evacuated. Though there was damage to property human lives were saved.
This reiterates why developing economies should look beyond immediate needs and invest in future

Although this certainly is the time for a steadfast focus on relief efforts - and not finger-pointing - one cannot help but wonder if more lives could have been saved but for the catastrophic mismanagement on the part of the authorities. Unlike an earthquake (or to a lesser extent, a tsunami), the likely path and ferocity can now be forecasted days in advance using satellite imagery and ocean-atmospheric coupled models. Even the ancillary dangers of a cyclone such as storm surge and flooding are relatively well understood and ought to have been accounted for by the authorities. To this end, my colleagues and I watched on in utter dismay as villagers standing in the path of the impending CAT 5 (>300kph wind gusts) attempted to ‘fortify’ their shanty dwellings instead of fleeing for refuge in higher ground (to escape storm surge) or hopping on a short ferry ride to shelter in the more sturdily built structures in Cebu. The fact that they were ushered into action suggested that they were informed that a cyclone was on its way – but the quality of information and pre-emptive disaster mitigation strategies must be reviewed.  Tacloban in particular should have been completely evacuated owing to its geographical position at the mouth of Leyte gulf where winds would have whipped up an enormous storm surge within the gulf, and widespread flooding anticpated due to the wringing of more moisture from the system by its mountain ranges.  This catastrophe serves as a very harsh reminder that policy/ scientific-communication/awareness and political will sorely lag behind science itself.  Until governments demonstrate genuine effort in changing the status quo, preventable tragedies such as Haiyan will occur in the future, especially in a world where climate extremes are increasingly becoming the norm...

Birth control is crucial for the Philippines. 103 million people in  fragmented island chain of limited resources is a sin allowed by the Church. Corruption and indifference makes it worse. Typhoons will happen and more will die. Filipinos must wake up to this.

From a purely ecological perspective, culling by the weather is the only acceptable way. No birth control, there is hardly any way for the government to provide for the people let alone to cope with disasters like a typhoon. The countries that need to have more babies are not and the countries that cannot afford to have that many babies are having more than they can care for.

The Philippines has weather forecasting facilities. The problem is that disaster response operations are not very efficient and there are conflicts among local politicians even in the distribution of relief goods.

First - I thank the world for all the help extended to my country.  I also thank you for all your comments though I have noticed that most are blamed on the country's poverty and corruption.  I would like to commend the efforts done by the government and the Filipino people before and after the storm.  10,000 people have died.  Yes, it could have been prevented and the absolute way of preventing it is to evacuate the whole provinces...all residents of the different islands that were smashed by the typhoon.  Doable? Yes, but it requires weeks..probably months because we would need a massive space for the evacuees.  It may be easy for anyone to say that the cause is the lack of preparation but have you really understood my country's geography?  We are a group of small islands...not a massive land like europe, america or the greater asia.  The structures that we thought would be a safe place for us were also swallowed by the water and smashed by the wind.  Tacloban is a flat land bounded by waters and the land area was easily drowned by the water that surrounds it.

Is there any wild guess if the majority of people in public buildings survived this disaster? Somehow, this error of people not leaving their houses reminds me of Katrina.

Typhoon Haiyan has turned out to be of real biblical proportions. The Filipino people are nice, decent and God fearing but believe in God in a wrong way i.e. father son and holy ghost. Does a father god kill and destroy his children like this? And the second typhoon is following Haiyan may be it is already there now. Osama Bin Ladin's body was drowned in these seas. Is the real God now starting his revenge which will include America too? America is already suffering from such tornadoes - Katrina, Sandy, etc. Rome had suffered a terrible earthquake after they had killed Jesus. May the real God have mercy on all of us?

The opening of the world climate congress in Poland devoted a few minutes to the tragedy, but these delegates, like those before them, will not have the courage to face the ultimate problems: over-population and over-consumption.
Those of us living in the 1st world are encouraged by our governments to buy thousands of useless products a year, to keep employment high. And those of us living in the developing world want to join the spending spree for i- and other junk.

Obviously, Philippines per se is a catastrophe.
You will see lots of people starving and die from disease.
The country is totally unprepared. Delivery of aids over many islands will be extremely difficult. Military is totally inefficient and incompetent. President Aquino will be very lucky if he's not ousted by riots!

My condolences go to the Philippine people.
Yet, what have the Philippine government been doing in prevention planning and relief planning? What has it been doing with fortifying the infrastructure through all these decades? The exact timing and the exact path of the typhoons may be surprises, but the typhoons are certain a regularity in that country. The government (the present one and all the past ones) are morally culpable for the 10,000 dead and many more displaced.
Right after WW2, the Philippines (thanks for American governance) was the 2nd most advanced country in the West Asia-Pacific (not counting Australia and NZ). Now, it is poorer than Indonesia. The Philippines have obviously been misgoverned for decades by their own elites. And the Philippine culture is too laid-back, too easily self-satisfied, and complacent. I say all these with sadness, not with condescension. The Philippines could be (and deserves to be) a much better place to live.

I had a close encounter with the almighty Haiyan in Hainan island, where the center of Haiyan was only 80km away from Sanya. It didn't do much damage there, except some fallen trees and billboards. Sorry for the folks in the Philipines. They took a hit for the team.

You are absolutely right. The Philippines is rich in natural resources, but corruption in government is the curse that keeps most Filipinos poor. The elite mainly protects its own interests. However, complacency is not a national trait. Many Filipinos are working hard in our country and abroad, but millions are still mired in poverty because of lack of opportunities. And sadly, the poorest are having more and more children that they can barely feed, believing that the larger one's family is, the more "blessed" one is. This situation, which results in the presence of numerous informal settlers in makeshift houses, causes extreme difficulty in saving lives when a disaster strikes. I think what the Philippines must do in the long run, apart from purging the bureaucracy of corrupt officials, is to reassess its value system. Rather than argue about the "morality" of reproductive health, the Church and the State should come up with a conclusive, viable solution to poverty. Having said that, I also hope the wealthy Catholic Church would provide more financial support to the poorest families so that their children (barefoot, in some cases) could go to school instead of eking out a living by selling candles in church patios.
