Jesse Matthew, the suspect in the case of missing UVA student Hannah Graham arrived back in Charlottesville on Friday after being arrested in Texas.


GALVESTON CO., Texas - 
Jesse Matthew, a suspect in the disappearance of UVA student Hannah Graham, is back in Charlottesville.A spokesperson for the city says Matthew arrived around 5:45 p.m. at Charlottesville-Albemarle Regional Airport on Friday.Matthew is being held at the Charlottesville-Albermarle Police Department without bond. His bond hearing is set for Thursday, Oct. 2. The time of that hearing will be decided by the court.========================As search for Hannah Graham continues, most of the City of Charlottesville has been searched.On Friday, crews worked in Albermarle County. Where they'll focus next depends on investigative tips from police.Search teams used dogs and state-of-the-art technology. No massive searches with volunteers are planned this weekend, but trained search teams will be out.The search has not yet stretched to surrounding counties.Search and rescue team leaders say even the smallest shred of evidence could break this case."Footprints that may or may not belong to anybody related to the investigation, we're looking for anything that may have been dropped on the ground and then of course we're always being vigilant for anything that's out of place," said Billy Chrimes, VDEM search and rescue coordinator.Investigators still believe they'll find Graham, but say every second counts."At this time we still hold out hope that she'll be found alive. Again, with time, that always diminishes a little bit but we hold out hope that that is a possibility," Chrimes said.Investigators are asking the public to be extra vigilant and report anything suspicious to police.=========================Jesse Matthew has been taken from a Texas jail and appears to be headed to Virginia.WDBJ7 Anchor Chris Hurst said Matthew was taken from the jail in Galveston County around 12:45 p.m. central time.  It is not clear when he will arrive back in Virginia.Galveston County Sheriff Henry Trochesset said they didn’t have any issues with Matthew while he was in jail.“He was quiet, he didn’t seem to have any issues. We had him in administrative segregation because of the high profile case,” Trochesset said.========================Abduction suspect Jesse Matthew's waiver paperwork has been signed and sent to the governor's office in Texas, which is procedure for that state.Virginia officials will have to go to Texas and take Matthew back to Virginia to face charges. There is no word yet on when this will happen, but it could be as early as Friday.Charlottesville's police chief wants landowners in the area to search their properties for any signs of Graham.Police say finding pieces of her clothing would be a big break for investigators.Graham was wearing a silver crop-top and black pants the night she disappeared.Her iPhone case could also stand-out, because it's pink.==================Investigators say in light of all that’s happening in Texas, they are continuing to keep their eyes on what they must do – find Hannah Graham.Chief Tim Longo said despite their best efforts, investigators still have no idea where Graham is.

He added her iPhone 5s had a pink case.He said if anyone comes across something that meets the descriptions to do not touch it and call the tip line at 434-295-3851 so the items can be properly recovered. Longo said investigators have received around 1,500 or 1,600 tips so far throughout the investigation. He said tips can be emailed to cpdtips@charlottesville.org.Longo explained investigators are moving south into Albemarle County to search for Graham. He asked property owners to search their land and document their inspections.Longo said there is no evidence that Graham new Matthew before her disappearance.He said investigators have spoken with family members, but he would not disclose the substance of those discussions.===============================The suspect in the case of missing UVa student Hannah Graham has waived extradition.  Jesse Matthew, Jr stood before the judge and when asked if he waived extradition, he simply answered "yes."Judge Michelle Slaughter told Matthew to have a nice day before she sent him back to jail where he will await the arrival of Charlottesville, Virginia police.
