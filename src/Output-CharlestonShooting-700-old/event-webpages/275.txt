 Related: Charleston shooting: Emanuel AME church reopens for first service 

The White House said on Monday that Barack Obama will travel to Charleston, South Carolina, on Friday, to memorialise the victims of last week’s shooting at a historic black church.
The US president will deliver the eulogy at the funeral services of the Rev Clementa Pinckney, the pastor of the Emanuel AME church where the shooting that killed nine people occurred.
Obama and first lady Michelle Obama got to know the pastor, who was also a state senator, during the 2008 presidential campaign. Pinckney was an early Obama supporter.
In the immediate aftermath, Obama said the shootings showed the need for a national reckoning on gun violence. 
On Friday, at a press conference in San Francisco, he said: “More than 11,000 Americans were killed by gun violence in 2013 alone. 
“If Congress had passed some commonsense legislation after Newtown, after a group of children had been gunned down in their own classroom, reforms that 90% of the American people supported … we might still have more Americans with us.”
The president has continued to advocate for gun control legislation since.
