Yeah, no. Because of a few sick fucks stand out on top doesn’t mean the entire site is bad. Besides, these kind of posts happen often. I reaaaaally doubt those that where cheering him on thought it was real.

Creepy nerds would meet elsewhere. That doesn’t solve anything. If the professors were lock and loaded, lives could’ve been saved.

Here’s a thought for you; There are chatbots that regularly post on 4chan. What if the thread were comprised of chatbots responding to each other?

Track down the loser emo-nerds who cheered the shooter on and charge them with accessory to murder. 4chan is filled with anti social degenerate pedophilic spoiled little misogynist weaklings and this shooter fit right in with them. Hopefully they will begin committing mass suicide because they are a complete waste of air.

Maybe instead of the president preaching gun control he should call a spade a spade and say keep your guns away from your teens.

The govt promised to stop these after virginia tech shooting, every one has been a nut and all around them knew it.  No one turns them in and they are allowed to buy assault weapons.  It is time that schools, shrinks, and all people be vigilant to stop this.  Guns don’t kill people, people kill people.  All of these people are nuts!  If you want to pass laws, control the nuts and prevent them from being allowed to purchase guns.  The FBI data base used to provide the gun check should have a list of all mentally disturbed people and deny any sales to people who are known by everyone around them to be crazy This will continue until the media stops giving them a stage for all the world to see, and provide a catalyst for other copy cats. It is time for the media and government to stand up and stop this.  No known mass killer has been sane or a legitimate gun owner.  Stop the crazy’s and everyone watch and keep vigilant.  Remember other mass shootings have been stopped by citizens stepping forward and reporting to authorities.  Those on the website participating are actually part of the conspiracy by what they said and posted.  They were part of the planning and told him how to do it.  Remember just because you are on social media does not mean you can conspire to kill!  You are part of the problem not part of the solution.
