How your money will help children affected by the typhoon
It's six months since Typhoon Haiyan, the strongest storm on record, devastated the Philippines.
Over six thousand lives were lost and more than a million homes destroyed. Many children lost loved ones and were left homeless, struggling to survive. World Vision assisted quickly with food, clean water and emergency shelters.
Six months on, children still need our help.
We’re working hard with communities that were devastated by the Typhoon to rebuild homes, schools and health clinics.  Children are being protected with safe places to learn and play.  Please give now, to help promise Filipino children a brighter future 
Please give now

£40 could provide three children with the basics - school bag, pens and paper - to help them get back into school
£60 could rebuild a latrine for a family 
£160 could help a family rebuild their home
