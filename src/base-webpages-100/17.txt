Nepal earthquake 2015



'People have nothing left': scale of Nepal quake devastation emerges









Rescuers reaching Gorkha, at the centre of the earthquake zone, describe entire villages reduced to rubble and a ‘long-term emergency’ ahead

Helicopters have been crisscrossing the skies above the mountains of Gorkha district in Nepal, ferrying the injured to clinics, and taking emergency supplies back to remote villages near the epicentre of the weekend earthquake that has killed more than 4,400 people across the region.
Around noon on Tuesday, two helicopters brought in eight women from Ranachour village, two of them clutching babies to their breast, and a third heavily pregnant.
“There are many more injured people in my village,” said Sangita Shrestha, who was pregnant and visibly downcast as she got off the helicopter. She was quickly surrounded by Nepalese soldiers and policemen and ushered into a waiting van to be taken to a hospital.
The little town of Gorkha, the district’s administrative and trading centre, is being used as a staging post to get rescuers and supplies to those remote communities after Saturday’s magnitude 7.8 earthquake. Some villages were reachable only by air after landslides blocked mountain roads.

Some women who came off the helicopters were grimacing and crying in pain and unable to walk or speak, in agony three days after being injured in the disaster.
Sita Karki winced when soldiers lifted her. Her broken and swollen legs had been tied together with crude wisps of hay twisted into a makeshift splint. “When the earthquake hit, a wall fell on me and knocked me down,” she said. “My legs are broken.” 
After an hour of dark clouds gathering and threatening rain, the wind kicked up in Gorkha and sheets of rain began to pour down.

Geoff Pinnock, of the UN’s World Food Programme, was leading a convoy of lorries north toward the worst-affected areas when the rain began to pound, leaving them stuck.
“This rain has caused a landslide that has blocked my trucks,” he said. “I can maybe get one truck through and take a risk driving on the dirt, but I think we’ll have to hold the materials back to try to get them out tomorrow by helicopter.”

Aid workers who had reached the edges of the epicentre described entire villages reduced to rubble.
“In some villages, about 90% of the houses have collapsed. They’re just flattened,” said Rebecca McAteer, an American physician who rushed to the quake zone from the distant Nepal hospital where she works.

And yet, the timing of the earthquake near midday, when most rural people were working in the fields, meant most villagers were spared of injuries when buildings collapsed, she said. So far, police say they have 373 confirmed deaths in the Gorkha district.
Most of those injured, she added, were young people and the elderly, since most young men long ago left their villages in search of better-paying work. “The immediate need is getting support to where it’s needed, but there will be a lot of work rebuilding,” said McAteer, who was heading back soon to the centre of the quake zone.
Thomas Meier, an engineer with the International Nepal Fellowship who accompanied McAteer to the devastated villages, said the disaster’s aftermath would stretch long into the future: “This is a long-term emergency. This will need major attention for the next five years. People have nothing left.”

Gorkha district, Nepal

Across central Nepal, including in Kathmandu, the capital, hundreds of thousands of people are still living in the open without clean water or sanitation. It rained heavily in the city on Tuesday, forcing people to find shelter wherever they could.
At Kathmandu airport, flights arrived with emergency aid and helicopters brought in both foreign trekkers and local villagers from quake-struck areas. Helicopters chartered by trekking companies reached the Langtang area, about 40 miles north of Kathmandu and a popular area for trekking – a key contributor to the country’s economy.
Dave Gordon, a trekker from San Francisco, in the US, said he was in the area until Tuesday waiting for the rescue flight.
“Cliffs came down, four or five porters were deceased, buried in the rockfall,” he said of the quake. “Trails are completely destroyed. People are stuck. They can’t get out. It was very bad.”
The United Nations said it was releasing $15m (£10m) from its central emergency response fund for quake victims. The funds would allow international humanitarian groups to scale up operations and provide shelter, water, medical supplies and logistical services, UN spokesman Farhan Haq told reporters on Monday.
Trucks carrying food were on their way to affected districts outside the hard-hit and densely-populated Kathmandu valley, and distribution of the food was expected to start on Tuesday.

Citing government figures, Haq said an estimated 8 million people had been affected in 39 of Nepal’s districts, and more than 1.4 million need food assistance, including 750,000 who live near the epicentre in poor-quality housing.
The UN humanitarian country team for Nepal is co-ordinating international relief efforts with the government and a clearer picture of needs should emerge within the next 48 hours, he said. The immediate priority was search and rescue, and removing debris to find survivors still trapped, he said.
Many of the ornate, historic buildings in Bhaktapur, a tourist site just east of Kathmandu, were reduced to rubble. Residents began returning to collect whatever belongings they could.
The number dead in Nepal has risen to 4,355, said the deputy inspector general of police, Komal Singh Bam. Another 61 were killed in neighbouring India, and China’s official Xinhua news agency reported 25 dead in Tibet. At least 18 of the dead were killed at Mount Everest as the earthquake unleashed an avalanche that buried part of the base camp packed with foreign climbers preparing for summit attempts.
Some 8,063 people have been injured, Bam said. Tens of thousands are believed to be homeless.
Rescue workers and medical teams from at least a dozen countries were helping police and troops in Kathmandu and surrounding areas, said Maj Gen Binod Basnyat, a Nepal army spokesman. Contributions came from countries such as India and China, but also from Nepal’s tiny Himalayan neighbour of Bhutan, which dispatched a medical team.
Medical and rescue teams from Russia, Japan, France, Switzerland and Singapore were expected in Kathmandu over the coming days, the Nepal army said.
