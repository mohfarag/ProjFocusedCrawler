DURHAM, N.C. — Durham police are investigating an early morning officer-involved shooting at a McDonald’s restaurant.
Officers received a call just before 4 a.m. about a robbery at 3117 Tower Blvd. When they arrived, all the lights in the restaurant were off but officers noticed movement inside.
As police went inside the business, they saw a man with his arm around a female employee’s neck. The suspect repeatedly threatened to kill the employee, according to a preliminary investigation.
