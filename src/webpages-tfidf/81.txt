The prime suspect in the abduction of Hannah Graham has been linked to the disappearance, rape and murder of Virginia Tech student Morgan Harrington, it was revealed on Monday.Virginia State Police this morning confirmed the arrest of Jesse ‘LJ’ Matthew had provided a ‘new forensic link’ to detectives investigating the disappearance of 20-year-old Morgan in October 2009. Police described the dramatic development as a ‘significant break’. Scroll down for video  
 
Suspect: The man suspected in the recent abduction of 18-year-old Hannah Graham(left)--Jesse Matthew, Jr. (right)--has been linked to the 2009 abduction and murder of Virginia Tech student Morgan Harrington, 20, according to Harrington's mother Gil Harringto  
 Police revealed Monday that evidence appears to link the still open abduction-murder case of Morgan Harrington (pictured), who vanished outside a Charlottesville Metallica concert in 2009, with the suspect in the recent disappearance of UVA student Hannah GrahamMorgan’s brutal murder has already been linked by DNA to the rape of a 26-year-old woman in Fairfax, Virginia in September 2005. If the link between Morgan’s disappearance and Matthew is confirmed, the 32-year-old will be accused of the abduction, rape or sexual assault of at least four young women over a 14-year period.The abduction ‘with intent to defile’ (a legal term for sexual assault) of UVA student Hannah Graham in September 2014.The murder of Virginia Tech student Morgan Harrington in October 2009Sexual assault of a 26-year-old woman in Fairfax, Virginia, in September 2005Rape of a Liberty University student in October 2002 Morgan’s mother, who has tirelessly campaigned to bring her daughter’s killer to justice, told local TV station WTVR.com: ‘We worked five years to get to this point, so we are relieved.’ The disappearances of a further five young women from the area around Charlottesville, known as the Route 29 corridor, remain unexplained.Two years after Morgan Harrington’s remains were found, the FBI released a sketch of a man seen with the student.




Hannah Graham suspect linked to 2009 rape and murder













The sketch was released after investigators found forensic evidence that linked a 2005 sex assault in Fairfax to Harrington’s disappearance. Virginia State Police refused to link Hannah’s disappearance with the Morgan Harrington case when contacted by MailOnline last Thursday.Spokeswoman Corinne Geller said: ‘The disappearance and death of Morgan Harrington remains a separate and ongoing criminal investigation by Virginia State Police. There is nothing new to release at this time concerning the progress of the Harrington case.’ The disappearances of a further five young women from the area around Charlottesville, known as the Route 29 corridor, remain unexplained. 
 
Was this a sketch of Matthew? Police sketched out the suspect at left after the 2005 was connected to Harrington's murder in 2009. At right, a photo of Matthew when his hair was far shorter than it is today  
 Pictured: Matthew was working as a taxi driver at the time of Morgan’s disappearance and would offer lifts for free to girls, according to a source with detailed knowledge of his past. A source told MailOnline: ‘LJ got in trouble with work because he would pull up in his cab alongside girls walking along and he would ask random girls'  
 Christian college student: A team photo of the 2002 Liberty University Football team that included Jesse Matthews. Matthew, the man suspected of abducting missing UVA student Hannah Graham, was behind bars Wednesday night after he was dramatically arrested in TexasHowever a source with detailed knowledge of Matthew’s background alerted MailOnline to a likely link with Morgan’s disappearance as soon as he was charged with Hannah Graham’s abduction.Speaking to MailOnline the source said: ‘After Morgan disappeared LJ [Matthew] started growing his hair and shaved off his beard.‘I mentioned to him that he looked like the man in the sketch [of a suspect issued by police following Morgan’s disappearance]. ‘It was the spitting image of him.‘He didn’t reply, he just said “oh”, which was unusual. He normally always had something to say.‘Even friends from elementary school said he looked like the man in the sketch.‘At the time when the incident happened he had a beard and short hair. And he was a lot darker then.  
 Taken away: Morgan's skeletal remains were found in January 2010 on a farm in Albemarle County - around four miles away from where she disappeared 
 
Left alone: Harrington left the 2009 Metallica concert alone and witnesses claim a woman fitting her description was seen hitchhiking at a bridge near the concert venue‘But he grew his hair out and shaved his beard off.‘He had his hair twisted. And then he grew it out into dreads and he wore it in a pony tail.’Yesterday Virginia State Police confirmed this suspicion.A spokeswoman said in statement: ‘For the past give year, the Virginia State Police has been aggressively pursuing the investigation into the disappearance and death of 20-year-old Morgan D Harrington of Roanoke, VA.‘Last week the arrest of Jesse L Matthew, 32, of Charlottesville, Virginia, provided a significant break in this case with a new forensic link for state police investigators to pursue.‘There is still a great deal of work to be done in regards to this investigation and we appreciate the public’s patience as we move forward.’Morgan Harrington vanished from John Paul Jones Arena while attending a Metallica concert in October 2009. Her remains were discovered on a farm in Albemarle County in January 2010.  
 Got their man? FBI agents lead Matthew out of a plane after his extradition from Texas, where he was discovered camping on a beach September

I’ll take you wherever you want to go for free”.‘One time he tried to follow one girl into her home.’Meanwhile the search for Hannah Graham continues.
