Ouagadougou: Burkina Faso's President Blaise Compaore has been toppled as the army took power after protesters set parliament ablaze in a popular uprising against the veteran leader's 27-year rule.
The demonstrators earlier on Thursday forced the government to scrap a vote on controversial plans to allow Mr Compaore to extend his reign, with tens of thousands of people joining a mass rally in the capital Ouagadougou calling for him to go.
Hundreds of people stormed parliament and other public buildings including the national television headquarters, ransacking offices and setting fire to cars, despite a heavy police and army presence across the capital.

The army, in a hastily arranged press conference, announced it was seizing power and pledged to restore constitutional order within 12 months. It imposed a dusk-to-dawn curfew and announced the dissolution of Mr Compaore's government and the national assembly, and the creation of a transitional body to run the country.

The communique, read out by an officer, was signed by army chief of staff Nabere Honore Traore.
There was no mention of Mr Compaore's whereabouts.

"The army is united with the people," said Benewende Sankara, a leading light in the opposition.
General Traore had earlier met with retired general Kouame Lougue, a former defence minister being touted by the opposition as a replacement for Mr Compaore, to discuss the crisis.
Tens of thousands of protesters massed on the streets of the capital shouting "Lougue in power!"

Emergency services said at least three protesters were shot dead and several others wounded by security forces when the crowd tried to storm the home of Mr Compaore's brother. Security forces also fired live rounds and tear gas at protesters near the presidency in the Ouaga 2000 neighbourhood.
Black smoke swirled in the air above parliament after demonstrators lit fires inside the building before looting computers and television screens and wheeling away police motorcycles.
MPs had been due to vote on Thursday on a government plan to change the constitution to allow Mr Compaore - who took power in a coup in 1987 - to stand for re-election next year, when he was due to stand down.

"We did this because Blaise was trying to stay too long. We are tired of him," said Seydou Kabre, a protester in Ouagadougou. "We want a change. He must go!"
State television was forced off the air after the building was taken. Soldiers deployed outside state radio with an armoured personnel carrier to defend it from the crowd.
Mr Compaore has ruled the cotton and gold-producing nation with a firm grip but in recent years he has faced increasing criticism, including from within his own camp and the military. Burkina Faso ranks 183rd out of 186 countries on the UN's Human Development Index.

"If needs be we are going to march to the presidency. We want Blaise Compaore to leave, We want change," said George Sawadogo, a 23-year-old student.
