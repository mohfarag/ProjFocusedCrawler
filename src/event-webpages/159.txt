Thousands of villagers, including those from an area devastated recently by an earthquake, have been forced to leave their homes as a powerful typhoon approaches the Philippines.

Typhoon Haiyan has already built up winds of 134mph and gusts of 155mph and there are fears it could get even stronger before it reaches Eastern Samar on Friday.
The head of the government's main disaster response agency said people are being moved from communities prone to landslides and flooding.
These include residents of Bohol, many of whom are still living in tents following the earthquake.




Haiyan is expected to cause massive damage

Haiyan is not expected to hit the province directly but it will almost certainly be lashed by strong wind and rain, say forecasters.
The military says Army troops are helping to deliver food packs and other items to communities that are hard to reach and rescue helicopters are on stand-by.
The typhoon is forecast to barrel through the country's central region on Friday and Saturday before heading towards the South China Sea on Sunday.
Manila, the densely-populated capital in the north, should not be affected.
Haiyan will be the 24th such storm in the Philippines this year, even more than usual. The annual average is 20.
