Despite 24 hours of national grieving over the killing of nine churchgoers by a gunman in Charleston, South Carolina, momentum toward fresh gun-control legislation remained at a near-standstill in Washington on Friday.

White House officials claimed all possible presidential efforts had been “exhausted” after previous mass shootings and said Barack Obama did not anticipate action from Congress either, since he was “very realistic about the political realities”.
“If you go back to 2013, when the president worked very hard to exhaust every possible avenue to tackle this issue – in fact, we completed 23 executive actions – we didn’t leave anything in the cupboard on steps that we could take to address this,” spokesman Eric Schultz told reporters as Obama travelled to a political fundraiser in Los Angeles.
Schultz’s comments were even gloomier than Obama’s had been during a brief statement on Thursday responding to the mass killings, in which he said the country would have to reckon with gun violence “at some point” but acknowledged that the “politics in this town foreclose[d] a lot of those avenues right now”.
“The president was very clear that the biggest, boldest action would have to be taken by Congress,” explained Schultz when pressed on whether Obama was in effect giving up on the prospect of reform in his remaining term.

“We commenced a significant lobbying campaign to Congress, and we fell short,” added the White House spokesman. “Congress fell short. Congress was not able to take this on. And the president was clear today in his remarks about the political realities that we do face in Congress and in Washington right now.”
There was near-silence on Capitol Hill. Senators Pat Toomey and Joe Manchin, authors of the last failed legislative attempt at gun control after the Sandy Hook school shooting, issued brief statements on Twitter offering “prayers” and “thoughts” to the victims of the latest attack but not mentioning gun control.

#CharlestonShooting is a terrible tragedy. Strong community and leaders will guide the city through this. All impacted are in my thoughts.

Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton said it was now time “not just to talk, but to act”. “How many innocent people in our country – from little children, to church members to movie theater attendees – how many people do we need to see cut down before we act?” she asked.
But her generalised comments were overshadowed by a swift reaction from several Republican opponents who reiterated their determination to defend second amendment gun rights. 
“There’s a sickness in our country, there’s something terribly wrong, but it isn’t going to be fixed by your government,” the libertarian Republican presidential candidate Rand Paul told a group of religious conservatives in Washington. 
Even public opinion, which polls suggest is overall in favour of limited gun control measures, has tended not to move after mass shootings, according to studies by Pew Research.
As a result, more than two years after the Sandy Hook elementary school massacre in Newtown, Connecticut, prompted nationwide calls for stricter gun laws, the prospects of passing any meaningful firearm reforms through Congress look slimmer than ever.

Gun control rose to the top of Obama’s agenda at the start of his second term, after 20-year-old gunman Adam Lanza shot and killed 20 children and six educators, and then himself, on 14 December 2012. The president, who had been reluctant until then to push for tighter gun restrictions despite several mass shootings in his first term, threw his support behind a ban on assault weapons and high capacity magazines and universal background checks for those buying firearms.
Obama even used his 2013 state of the union address to make an emotional appeal for a vote on background checks, an impassioned plea that was immediately dubbed one of the most memorable moments of his presidency.
“The families of Newtown deserve a vote. The families of Aurora deserve a vote. The families of Oak Creek, and Tucson, and Blacksburg, and the countless other communities ripped open by gun violence – they deserve a simple vote,” Obama said, referring to the victims of several mass shootings during his time in office.
Two months later, the families of the children who perished in the Sandy Hook shooting watched as the US senate failed to advance a single measure to reduce gun violence – despite holding consecutive votes on bills designed to expand background checks, ban assault weapons, limit high-capacity ammunition and prevent illegal gun trafficking across state lines.
The compromise bill on federal background checks, viewed at the time as the most achievable legislation during the debate, was filibustered by Senate Republicans and a handful of Democrats facing tough re-election battles in conservative states.
Congress has since shown no real appetite to revisit gun control, which continues to be a thorny political issue for politicians who fear a backlash from the National Rifle Association and other gun rights’ activists. The NRA has routinely spent millions trying to defeat pro-gun control lawmakers in previous election cycles.
A coalition of anti-gun violence groups formed after the Newtown shooting has sought to rival the gun lobby with its own war chest aimed at politicians opposed to what they call “common sense” gun reforms. But their efforts have focused primarily on legislatures at the state level, where lawmakers have been more amenable to passing bills that would close loopholes in the background checks system and prevent individuals convicted of domestic violence from obtaining firearms.
Such initiatives continue to have little hope of becoming law at the federal level, particularly with Republicans who overwhelmingly dispute the need for stricter gun laws now at the helm of both chambers of Congress.
Obama has been relegated to quietly signing modest proposals into law using his executive authority – his administration announced a pair of actions last year aimed at limiting firearm access for individuals with mental health issues.
A December report found that nearly 100 school shootings have occurred since Sandy Hook, resulting in at least 45 deaths and 78 non-fatal gunshot injuries.
