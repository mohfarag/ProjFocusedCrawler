Florida State football recruiting has been very, very good under head coach Jimbo Fisher. The Seminoles recruiting classes have ranked 9th, 2nd, 3rd and 10th in his four seasons as head coach.
The 2014 recruiting class is shaping up to be another top-10 haul. But it's not without its unique challenges. Florida State lost seven coaches after the 2012 season, and the new coaches are working to establish new relationships with high school coaches and recruits. Plus, Florida State needs a lot of recruits -- at least 28, and perhaps more. Some recruits don't want to come in with many other players at their position.





All verbal commitments are non-binding until scholarship papers are signed on National Signing Day, or in the case of January enrollees, when the prospect enrolls.
The recruiting board will be dynamic and updated often. Be sure to bookmark this page, as we'll refer to it quite often. This is, of course, unofficial, as by rule, FSU cannot disseminate a recruiting board to the media or public.
Please note that there are some players FSU has offered who are not on the recruiting board. In our estimation, FSU's chance with those players is so remote that it does not make much sense to add them.
Click on the player's name for more information, including a scouting report, if available. The board is tabbed by position.
