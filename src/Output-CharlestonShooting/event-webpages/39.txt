Official: S.C. church shooting suspect to face hate crime charge

COLUMBIA, S.C. — An official says the man accused of slaying nine black church members in Charleston will soon face a federal charge.


An official close to the case told The Associated Press that a grand jury will indict 21-year-old Dylann Roof on Wednesday on a federal hate crime charge. The source spoke on the condition of anonymity because the indictment hadn’t been publicly announced yet.


The move has been expected since Roof’s arrest after the June 17 shootings at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church.


Federal officials have previously said the shootings meet the legal requirements for a hate crime and that federal charges were likely. Roof, who is white, appeared in photos waving Confederate flags and purportedly wrote of racial violence.


Roof faces state charges including nine murder counts. Prosecutors haven’t said whether they’ll seek the death penalty.

The suspect, who remains on the loose, is a white male about 21 years old, officials said.
    Authorities are looking for a young white man in connection to the massacre at the historic Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, SC where a gunman opened fire, killing nine people.
    WLTX TVThe shooting took place at about 9 p.m. ET on Wednesday. Charleston Police released photos of the suspect during a news conference that started at 6 a.m. ET Thursday, and said he left the scene in a black four door sedan. He is described as "armed and dangerous."#Breaking Charleston PD have released this flyer/pics of suspect in mass shooting at a South Carolina church @FOX59pic.twitter.com/6TD0azzt7D— Kristin Kane (@KristinKaneNews) June 18, 2015Church members were shot as they took part in shot at bible study, the NAACP said. Dot Scott, president of the Charleston NAACP, said a female survivor told family members that the gunman initially sat down in the church for a while before opening fire, the Post and Courier reported. Scott added that the gunman reportedly told the woman he was letting her live so she could tell others what happened.Among the dead was the state senator who was pastor of the church, Democrat Clementa Pinckney, said South Carolina House Minority Leader Todd Rutherford, the Associated Press reported. Pinckney, 41, was married with two children and had served in the state Senate since 2000, according to online biographies.USATODAY.COMBEHIND THE BLOODSHED: THE UNTOLD STORY OF AMERICA'S MASS KILLINGSPeople were taking part in a prayer meeting at the time of the incident, Mayor Joe Riley said during the press conference."This is inexplicable," Riley said.

The only reason someone could walk into church and shoot people praying is out of hate."Clementa Pinckney. (Photo: WLTX)Said Police Chief Mullen: "This is a tragedy that no community should have to experience.
