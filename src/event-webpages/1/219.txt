Sunday night, 247sports broke the news that Florida State had added it's 8th commit for the 2015 class, when offensive lineman David Robbins committed. Robbins is 6'3, 300 pounds and still growing. He has the ability to play anywhere along the offensive line, but projects most likely as a guard. Robbins, out of Maryland, had previously visited FSU in March and established a good relationship with offensive line coach, Rick Trickett. 
Robbins had offers from California, Maryland, Boston College and others. The Seminoles will continue to battle Maryland for his services, as they are the local school, though FSU has had success in the DMV (DC, Maryland, Virginia) area over the past years. David Robbins is Florida State's 8th recruit for the 2015 class and joins Cole Minshew as the second offensive line commit, though Kendrick Norton could end up on either the offensive or defensive side of the ball. Florida State will look to bring in a total of 4 - 5 offensive line recruits for the 2015 class.
