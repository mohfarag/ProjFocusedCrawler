NEWARK, NJ — Mark Jones, older brother of Reverend Sharonda Singleton can’t believe she was one of nine people shot to death at Emmanuel AME Church in South Carolina.


The accused killer, Dylann Roof is in police custody but the community, the families and just everyday citizens are still trying to find answers to why the shooting happened.


Jones said during a PIX 11 interview,


“I could sit here and say racism or hate and be angry but I will tell you like my sister would have this was not White or black, Yellow or brown this was a troubled soul.”


Singleton was a mother of three, her oldest son attends college at Charleston Southern University, Friday his classmates offered him words of encouragement.


Chris Singleton said “I just think about her smile. She smiles 24 / 7. That’s what I’m just thinking about to push me on to do stuff like this; just think about her smile.”


Singleton was raised in Newark New Jersey where dozens of people gathered for a prayer vigil Friday evening.
