        COMMENTEMAILMOREThe Charleston, S.C., church where nine people were shot and killed in what officials are calling a hate crime has a rich history.The Emanuel AME Church is the oldest African Methodist Episcopal church in the south, and is called "Mother Emanuel." The current pastor of the church was Rev. Clementa Pinckney, who was killed in the shooting.According to the official web site of the church, it grew under the leadership of Rev. Morris Brown in 1816, after he organized a church for people of color; it got its start as one of three churches that were part of the Bethel Circuit and Mother Emanuel's congregation grew out of one of those three institutions.USA TODAYSuspect in Charleston church rampage returns to South CarolinaThe history of the church touches on some of this country's most relevant moments. In 1822, it was investigated for its role in a planned slave revolt after one of its founders, Denmark Vesey, tried to organize a failed slave rebellion. He and other organizers were hanged. According to PBS, in the aftermath of the executions, "Vesey became a martyr for African-Americans and a symbol for the abolitionist movement, while the increasingly militant politics of white America dragged the country toward Civil War."Allen Sanders, right, kneels next to his wife, Georgette, both of McClellanville, S.C., as they pray at a sidewalk memorial on June 20, 2015, in memory of the shooting victims in front of Emanuel AME Church in Charleston, S.C. "You can't have love and hate residing in the heart at the same time," said Georgette. "We're just going to have to love one another," her husband added. (Photo: David Goldman, AP)

In 1834, after black churches were banned, the congregation worshiped secretly until 1865, when it was formalized and named Emanuel.Mother Nature also wasn't kind to the church. It was destroyed by an earthquake in August 1886. In 1891, the present edifice was finished and fully rebuilt between 1949 and 1951.The church had its share of notable political moments. In March 1909, Booker T. Washington spoke there, and in 1962, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and Wyatt T.

Mark Kelly Tyler, senior pastor of Emanuel's sister congregation, Mother Bethel AME Church in Philadelphia, on the documentary's Facebook page.The pastor of the Emanuel church, the Rev. Clementa Pinckney, who was killed in the shooting, is interviewed in the documentary, according to the trailer.
