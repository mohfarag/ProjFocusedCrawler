“ABDUCTION” and “SEXUAL ASSAULT” Confirmed – Missing Hannah Graham – Help Find  Jesse “LJ” Matthew and Call (434) 295-3851 Immediately

Posted on September 23, 2014 by sundance  

$50,000 REWARD

MAJOR Update Numerous Photographs : ABDUCTION CONFIRMED – SUSPECT: Jesse Leroy Matthew Jr.  Also might be a serial perpetrator of numerous abductions, Hannah Graham being his latest victim.  “ABDUCTION WITH INTENT TO DEFILE”

Nine victims, all of whom have disappeared in the past four years along a path that roughly follows Route 29 from Northern Virginia south to the Roanoke area: Morgan Harrington, Alexis Murphy, Cassandra Morton, Samantha Clarke, Jamisha Gilbert, Dashad “Sage” Smith, Heather Hodges, Bethany Decker and Cara Marie Holley.


Treepers – Lets see if we can collect any and all information possible on the suspect the police are now hunting. 
He is on the run.

Hannah Graham, the Virginia student who is missing, is suspected to have been abducted or harmed by a person named “Jesse Matthew”.
Suspect: Jesse “LJ” Matthew, black male, (age 32), dreadlocks and has a prior criminal history but mug shot not released. 

Police Chief Longo alluded to the fact the police dept is frozen in political correctness.
Police Chief Tim Longo gave an unusual press conference moments ago stating that this man, Jesse Matthew, walked into a police station, talked to an attorney, left with the attorney in a vehicle, and took off at a high rate of speed evading authorities. A warrant for his arrest is now public.

 

[Daily Mail Has an article about Jesse Matthew] The ‘person of interest’ in the case of missing UVA student Hannah Graham admits that he bought her drinks but denies he drove off with her in his car, MailOnline can reveal exclusively – as one thousand volunteers reportedly searched for her Saturday.
Jesse ‘LJ’ Matthew has confirmed he met the 18-year-old in Charlottesville’s Downtown Mall on the night she went missing and bought her drinks at a local bar.
But Matthew, a nursing assistant at UVA Hospital, told his mother that Hannah did not get into his car and that the pair ‘went their separate ways.’
‘Nearly 1,000 volunteers’ participated in a Saturday search for Graham, the Associated Press reported.
The volunteers were photographed wearing bright neon vests and carrying backpacks.
They were seen walking through fields and bushes in an attempt to find the college student.
Matthew’s grandmother, Christine Carr, told MailOnline on Saturday: ‘I have been talking with his mother.
‘He said he went his way and she went hers. He told his mother he bought her some drinks. He said she did not get into his car.
‘The girl went her way and he went his.’
Matthew has lived in Charlottesville his whole life, where he works in the operating room of the UVA Hospital, sources told MailOnline. He is a nursing assistant who transports patients to the operating room.
His grandmother, Mrs Carr, says she instantly recognized her grandson ‘LJ’ when she watched the video tape released by police investigating Hannah’s disappearance.
She told MailOnline: ‘I saw the video tape. That is him, that is LJ. The police went through his car and his apartment. (read more)

Somebody may be sheltering him. Upgrading the warrant from misdemeanor reckless driving to felony abduction would make harboring him a very serious offense. The police should explain the potential consequences in very simple language.  “If you are sheltering Jesse Matthew and don’t promptly call and turn him in, you will go to prison for many years.”
Unfortunately, the $50,000 reward for “safe return” probably doesn’t provide any incentive at this point in time. A $50,000 reward for information leading to the arrest of Jesse Matthew might work.

I’m surprised LE didn’t have a “tail” on him when he left the station.  imo, he’ll likely  shave his head to get rid of the dread locks/dump the car immediately.     The dread locks were a the identifying factor that made him stand out easily in the video, well, plus his size.

The cops chased him until JM reached such dangerous speeds that pursuit was dangerous for other drivers, with consideration at that time that he was not under arrest, no warrant was active, and he was only a person of interest wanted for questioning.
The warrant issued as a result of his reckless driving during that pursuit and has now been enhanced to include abduction and intent to defile.
The cops got some goodies back from the lab.

OK, if I am driving like a madman at speeds in excess of 20 mph over the stated limit, that alone as I understand warrants a full felony stop (police types, please advise… I was VERY bad in that respect on the weekend and want to know if my guilty feelers are justified or not).
Maybe the po po did not want to hurt his feelers, maybe they were worried that they’d be the cause of Al Sharpton or Daryl Crumpster to come to their fair city… and face mean questions, possibly even be called (gasp!)… a RACIST for doing their job and protecting civilians from savages such as depicted in this article.

Many jurisdictions have break-off pursuit policies because of the danger to pedestrians and other drivers.  JM wasn’t fleeing arrest or anything except being skeered to talk to the cops, probably on advice of counsel, so there would be hell to pay if the cops continued a high-speed pursuit and a bystander was injured or killed.  The cops made the right decision.
There are thousands upon thousands of blacks arrested every year.  Sharpton, Crump, etc., rarely show up for any of that.  Their M.O. is to show up when a black can be depicted as a victim and they smell some money.

They can’t do a pit maneuver in heavy, two-way surface street traffic.
JM wasn’t wanted for anything at that time, other than questioning.  There was no legal or criminal obligation for him to be in custody.  There would be no justification for endangering other drivers and pedestrians.
Let’s just look at his fleeing as evidence of JM’s consciousness of guilt and save it for trial.

“Why was he allowed to leave the police station the other day? Was it because they didn’t have enough evidence at the time for an arrest?”
Simple answer, because he’s black.
I don’t think I’ve ever seen such a screw up and on top of other things I’ve seen and heard from this chief regarding this case I’m certain the second they found their suspect to be black they immediately went into “oh chit” mode, obviously no need to explain why.
And so the suspect became, well, I don’t even know what to call him for that early part of the investigation, they didn’t even want to call him a “person of interest” muchless a “suspect”. He walks into the police station and apparently they discuss the weather with “the person” they wanted to talk to about the case but don’t talk to about the case.
Then they put “overt” surveillance on “the person”, this was emphasized by the chief at a press conference. It had to be overt for the same reason the Grand Jury transcripts will be made available in the Wilson/Brown case if they do not indict, transparency, or at least the appearance thereof. Why? Well, we know why.
All of this even though they had probable cause to search his car, then again to search his home then again to search his home and, clearly, reluctantly they were forced to, well, do the right thing but of course it’s too late now. But at least the white cops won’t look racist right? Or at least they tried not to.
This is going to be a mess of a trial if it even gets to that point, all these white folk so scurred to look racist I’m surprised black people are arrested anymore, how can they be when the cops won’t even call them suspect in the face of probable cause, good grief.

The cops had no grounds for an arrest at the time JM was at the police station.
It’s as simple as that.
The trial may or may not be a mess.  It depends on the quality of the evidence and the way it’s handled and presented.
You may not have noticed, but the black race hustlers usually only jump bad when they can manipulate the appearance of a black being a victim of whites.  We usually don’t see the whites of their eyes when the black is a perp in custody for a heinous offense.  They know they’re not going to get any $ympathy for a big ugly black dude that rapes and murders young women.  There are no deep pockets to pick on this one.

If you think anything has to be manipulated to give “the appearance of a black being a victim of whites” then you and I are clearly have a differing perception of the current climate in the U.S. regarding race Regardless, my condemnations are pointed at the white people involved much like they were in the Zimmerman/Martin case.

The problem is that you apparently don’t know anything about the law and police procedures.
I agree with you 100% about the racial climate in this country and all the racial PC bullcrap, but sometimes – SOMETIMES – there are good reasons for not doing a certain thing at a certain time when it comes to investigations that are just smart and have ZERO to do with PC race-fear.
THE COPS HAD NO LEGAL REASON TO HOLD JM, THUS THEY HAD NO JUSTIFIABLE BASIS FOR HIGH-SPEED CHASE OR ANY CHASE.
All that lawyer had to say to the cops is “You can’t talk to my client” and they’re done.  No talk, no pursuit, zip, nada, see ya’ later.
If the cops had continued the pursuit, and JM got in a wreck and was killed, and there was no basis for the chase to begin with because he was not in custody, not fleeing a crime scene, and had no active warrants at the time, THEN JM WOULD LOOK LIKE A VICTIM WHICH WOULD HAVE GIVEN THE RACE PIMPS WHAT THEY NEED TO STIR THE POT FOR A LAWSUIT.

“As of Tuesday afternoon, the state lab was still analyzing evidence it has received from the Charlottesville Police Department, which included nearly two dozen items and eight “known samples that we would use for comparison purposes,” said Jeffrey Ban, director of the Department of Forensic Science’s Central Laboratory in Richmond.
Ban said that the department has expedited the case and hoped to provide authorities with results in the “very near future.” But he noted the lab could spend hours or even a whole day on a single piece of evidence that may have multiple stains or hairs on it. He also said it is standard procedure to test any samples against those in their database, including those from other missing persons cases in the central Virginia area.”  (MSN)

The lab likely has a ton of stuff to test and analyze, but you can bet they’ve done enough already to be able to give a positive on JM for the cops or the cops wouldn’t have enhanced the warrant.  In other words, the lab work is ongoing but the cops have been given enough on the primary questions to go forward with the warrant.
Good work by the lab and the PD.

Thanks for that link.  What a sad case and what a horrible man.
In that case, the cops had the body and proof of the sexual assault and murder.  Crawford was charged with murder.  The “defilement” became evident during the autopsy.  In this case, we don’t have a body, which is why I’m not completely certain that with the “intent to defile” aspect of the warrant, the charges relate to Hannah, even though that’s what the news is reporting.  I never trust them to really have a clue as to what they’re reporting about.  The abduction charges may relate to one of the women who were abducted and assaulted but survived, being left on the street.  That victim may have identified JM and that may be backed up by DNA evidence now.  The cops likely have JM dead to rights on the abduction of Hannah, but the “intent to defile” aspect raises a question about the identity of the victim related to the warrant.  I’d like to see the probable cause affidavit or the information.  I’m not familiar with VA criminal procedure.  We can assume the charges relate to Hannah, but it’s not completely clear.

John, one other possibility might be that certain of Hannah’s bodily fluids were found in the car or on JM’s clothing taken from the apartment and were DNA matched to a hair from her hairbrush or her toothbrush, razor, etc., or other items and areas in her residence.  That could explain the “intent to defile” aspect.

One of the very few articles that mention Jesse’s upgraded “Wanted” status:
Jesse Matthew now charged with abduction with intent to defile
Longo issued an updated wanted poster for Jesse Matthew, now saying Matthew is charged with abduction with intent to defile.
-snip-
Longo wouldn’t comment what was the key piece of evidence to help elevate and obtain the new charge.

Strange charge “intent to defile”. Abduction would seem to indicate they have physical evidence from Hannah in JM’s car. If on his clothing it could be the result of contact on the street or restaurant. They aren’t going to want to issue an arrest warrant for abduction that a judge could toss out for lack of probable cause so they would have some serious evidence Hannah was in that car. But that ‘intent to defile’ is mysterious or ominous. You seen “intent to  sell or distribute” narcotics all the time on arrest warrants because there are clear legal thresholds. Too many pills or too large a quantity to qualify for personal use, e.g. but “intent to defile ” sadly sounds like they found a “rape kit” belonging to JM.

Don’t read too much into the “intent to defile” aspect.  This charge was used in the Alexis Murphy case, on which Randy Allen Taylor was detained, along with unrelated theft charges.   Authorities wanted to keep him in custody, since as a likely serial killer, he might skip.   Taylor was convicted on strong circumstantial evidence even though the victim has not been found.   I suspect that the “intent to defile” charge is just a means to trigger a massive APB, make harboring Matthew a crime, and require a much higher bond than a traffic violation.   Reportedly, it was Virginia State Police who were tailing Matthew but let him go for “safety concerns”.   Their very presence implies that LE were looking at  Matthew then as a possible serial killer — which makes letting him flee seem rather unsafe.

Why haven’t police mentioned the name of the attorney? That’s not covered under attorney-client privilege. Has the attorney been kidnapped? Are they an accomplice? Finding the attorney might be important to finding Matthew.

If Matthew was last seen with any person at all, what would be wrong about releasing the name? If I were Matthew’s attorney, I’d expect my name to be released under these circumstances.

The reason the police have now released the name of the attorney is because the warrant has issued and the attorney has noticed the PD and prosecutor of his representation of JM.  In other words, the representation is now official and the attorney’s name is now properly released.
The attorney isn’t hiding and he hasn’t been kidnapped.

I am really curious about what actually prompted the police to add the new charge for abduction w/ intent to defile. They must have, at least, been able to place Hannah in or very near his car. They may not even have lab results yet but newly uncovered (unreleased) video may have provided enough evidence for the new charge. I’m also wondering about the possibility of drug use in addition to the alcohol. I say this without judgement – I am curious why a person would be out and about, alone, in perhaps some unsavory areas, so late at night. Was she looking for something? Or perhaps under the influence of something else – which could be its own factor. I’m curious if Mr. Dreadlocks is possibly a drug pusher. So many possibilities here.

Ya, though I realize there are FAR more important factors here to concentrate on, I’m still curious as to what was meant by the statement about the PD being “frozen in political correctness”. It’s SO important that libs, the general public, etc. begin to realize just how damn dangerous the ramifications of PC can be. Seems like we may be coming to some kind of tipping point soon,  either where they may win by having such crap actually legislated, or we manage to Alinsky their own tactics against them by pointing out just how ridiculous & paralyzing this dreck has become–although I have no clue how to really demonstrate how it also hamstrings us in perilous ways.

New Orleans police today arrested two AA males, 16-year olds, after they carjacked a woman and later robbed, shot and killed a 35-yeart old pizza delivery man. Bad enough, one might say, but both were out on bail for other violent acts and were wearing ankle monitoring bracelets at the time of the carjacking and murder/robbery. Here’s the next rub – were they adults the sheriff’s department (in charge of the ankle monitor program)could have just gone out and arrested them; HOWEVER, as they were juveniles the SO had to get permission from a judge BEFORE they could go out and arrest them. Think things are going to change after this? Don’t hold your breath. Perhaps the perp could drive down here where the local judges and justice system will give him more rights and respect than the victims get.

They should give these thugs the death penalty, though they may be minors now, by the time it gets to trial maybe they will be 18, then add the 10 + yrs. it takes to drag a death penalty sentence through the legal system to INSURE the criminals have all their rights protected, they might be 28 yrs. old or older.

The judges who are so reluctant to send poor, minority youth (multiple) offenders into custody and the legislators that place so many roadblocks between the bad kids and the law are equally to blame. To requirement to hunt down a judge to ‘ask’ permission to arrest a youth offender, especially ones out on release for violent crimes, when an adult just gets snapped up, is ridiculous. Then again the Louisiana criminal process has always benefited the criminal so it shouldn’t be a surprise, I guess.

JUST REALIZED – If that is Jesse Matthew in the Red-Orange Car and he was watching Alexis Murphy – then forensic evidence ties him to the Alexis Murphy case and to Randy Allen Taylor’s mobile home.   If the guy in the car is Dameon Bradley that Randy Taylor named, was Bradley using Matthew’s car?  Were Bradley and Matthew friends or involved in criminal activities together with Taylor?
What if both Taylor and Matthew are connected to Darrell Rice who is now out of prison?
A bald guy matching Rice’s description was seen in the surveillance video standing outside of the fence watching Hannah Graham leave the bar.   A group of people at the bar, male and female, seemed to be interested in her.
What if this is a group with connections in DC, NY, etc. that are involved in drug, kidnapping and human trafficking?

I wondered the very same. perhaps she lost her phone which is why she never called anybody for help. Maybe someone found it later in that area of 14th st? and that was the last text she had typed, intoxicated- she failed to hit send… so they hit send upon finding? Easy to do inadvertently, if a touchscreen phone. Or maybe she dropped it while typing text, battery fell out/ powered off b4 transmitting. Person finds Around 1:20 AM and powers back on, text sends?
Just A couple theories to consider.
And possible JM sent the text to throw people off. AlThough it would make sense– seems unlikely considering they were in the bar at that point- correct?

“He looks like someone that is here in Durango CO. In fact I’m pretty sure I saw them both. They were sitting at a table outside of the Durango Coffee Company and it was pouring down rain and they were arguing. But I actually met him before that I’m sure. He is homeless and is staying in a tent behind Wal-Mart.. So if they are here then they are probably going to the soup kitchen.”

…
Then, according to Hallahan, the three of them – Taylor, Alexis and the unidentified man – drove three separate vehicles back to Taylor’s camper in Lovingston.
…
Hallahan says Alexis and the unidentified man left before sundown on August 3 in separate cars and Taylor hasn’t seen them since. |

If you search his Charlottesville friends (those who self-identify in their profiles) 
https://www.facebook.com/lj.matthew.5?fref=ts&ref=br_tf
you will find quite a few who are in the FB Help Find Mogan Harrington group.  Like Castro in Ohio, I think he got off on that–baffling or eluding those looking for his victims.  One very pretty reddish-haired white girl who did not identify as from Charlottesville also was a searcher.  A super good-looking white wioman with two black kids and rarely updated her FB had a big heart and for the Murphy girl (who was black and missing). I understand that a man was convicted for that murder.  Maybe wrongly?  Charlotteville, for those who have never been there, is (in my opinion) a super-liberal university small city, albeit in VA.  Here is LJ’s FB page.  As I say, check the “groups” for some of his 300 friends (especially pretty white girls) and you’ll see quite a few in the “Help Find Morgan Harrington” Facebook group.   https://www.facebook.com/lj.matthew.5?fref=ts&ref=br_tf

The sketch of the suspect in the Morgan Harrington case looks a lot like Alex McFadden, the suspect in the DaShad Laquinn  Smith case, who has disappeared.

As prior noted, here’s more info on prosecutors denying connection in Alexis Murphy case. They’re claiming that the (thought to be) car in corner of  CCTV shot, is just part of a sign:
http://m.dailyprogress.com/news/local/no-connection-between-graham-disappearance-and-alexis-murphy-prosecutors-say/article_a4975abe-438b-11e4-964d-0017a43b2370.html?mode=jqm
Perhaps it is. And yet some doubt still lingers:
1. Fails to explain the eerily similar car & physical descriptions, given by lawyer, Mike Hallahan, on behalf of Randy Taylor in 2012.
2. Prosecutors are not fond of admitting to any wrongful prosecution. Same goes for LE, can you imagine if they let Matthew slip thru the cracks!? Bc they had it out for Taylor well before this (See #5). My god, Hannah might not have been abducted!
So, they aren’t going to own the slightest possibility of, unless the lacking physical evidence a/o body were to surface, forcing the issue.
Prosecution centered on conjecture, & evidence was mainly circumstantial.
3. Same lawyer asked for the public’s help to ID & locate the black guy, Taylor alleged Alexis introduced him to the guy that very day.
However a Dameon Bradley, thought to be black guy,  proved to have an alibi per LE, on the night in question. Randy Taylor said early on he didn’t know the guy’s name.
So who actually ID Bradley? Was this a case of mistaken identity as a witness? Or all lies by Taylor??
4. According 2nd link (below)-
Randy Taylor just prior to, won his case against local police for unlawful search and seizure, having felt he was targeted & harassed unjustly by LE, during the “Samantha Clarke” 2012 disappearance. 
http://www.readthehook.com/108360/living-shadow-samantha-clarkes-family-mourns-suspect-claims-police-harassment
Note: despite LE Illegal search of his car, (GPS tracking, & tampering >traffic stop), there was never any evidence or eye witness accounts, linking him to the Samantha case. Only connection was a series of phone calls, pertaining to an angry girlfriend of a Mutual acquaintance, warning her about.

The following are Facebook friends of LJ Matthew who also were in the “Help Find Morgan Dana Harrington” Facebook group.  LJ may have more friends who were in the group.  Could he have had an abiding fascination in befriending searchers for Morgan?
