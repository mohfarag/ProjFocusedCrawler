Charleston, SC (

As of 9 a.m., the Mother Emanuel Hope Fund raised $176,049 and the Reverend Pinckney Fund raised $49,700.


Mayor Joseph Riley announced the creation of the Mother Emanuel Hope Fund at a news conference the day after the shooting. He said money donated to the fund will be used to help the families of the victims.


Officials said donations can be made by texting ‘prayforcharleston’ to 843-606-5995 or visiting

State Sen. Clementa Pinckney was one of nine people killed when police said a man, later identified as 21-year-old Dylann Roof, opened fire inside Emanuel AME Church during a prayer meeting.


According to city officials, all donations to the Pinckney fund will be used support church initiatives, and “vulnerable populations and youth projects that Reverend Pinckney was so passionate about.”
