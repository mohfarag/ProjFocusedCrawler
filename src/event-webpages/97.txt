Millions of people have been affected after typhoon Haiyan hit the Philippines on Friday. The category-five storm was one of the most powerful storms ever recorded to make landfall.
As the first consignments of aid begin to arrive in storm-devastated regions the Disasters Emergency Committee have launched an emergency appeal for food, water and shelter, and the UN have appealed for $300m to support relief efforts. 
If you have been affected by the storm, or have been moved from your home, we'd like to hear your stories, sharing your photos and videos with us. If you're an aid worker or a member of a humanitarian organisation involved in the relief effort – and are able to share your experiences – we would like to hear from you too.
We'd really like to see some video too – you can download GuardianWitness on your smartphone to record or send footage you've already taken – as well as using the desktop site. We'll use some of your content in our coverage.
Though we'd like to hear from you, your security is most important. We recognise it may not always be safe or appropriate to record or share your experiences – so please think about this when deciding whether to record and again when deciding whether to share your content on GuardianWitness.

GuardianWitness is the home of user-generated content on the Guardian. Contribute your video, pictures and stories, and browse news, reviews and creations submitted by others. Posts will be reviewed prior to publication on GuardianWitness, and the best pieces will feature on the Guardian site.
