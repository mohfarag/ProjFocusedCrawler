CHARLESTON, SC (June 18, 2015) — All nine victims in 
Wednesday night’s Charleston church shooting
 have officially been identified.


Charleston County Coroner Rae Wooten identified the nine shooting victims as follows: Cynthia Hurd, 54; Susie Jackson, 87; Ethel Lance, 70; Rev. DePayne Middleton-Doctor, 49; Hon. Rev. Clementa Pinckney, 41; Tywanza Sanders, 26; Rev. Daniel Simmons Sr., 74; Rev. Sharonda Singleton, 45; Myra Thompson, 59.


Eight of the victims died at the scene, and the ninth victim died at a hospital.


According to police, the shooter spent an hour at the Bible study before opening fire.


The gunman allegedly told the victims before the shooting, “You rape our women and you’re taking over our country. And you have to go,” said Sylvia Johnson, a cousin of the church’s slain pastor. She cited survivors of the shooting.


The suspect let one woman live show she could tell everyone else what happened, Dot Scott, president of the local branch of the NAACP, told CNN.


The FBI named Dylann Roof
, 21, of Lexington, South Carolina as the suspect in the shooting around 9 a.m. Thursday.


Police arrested Roof
 in Shelby, North Carolina Thursday morning around 11:15 a.m., nearly 14 hours after the shooting.


According to WLTX
, Roof was “cooperative” with the officer who stopped him. He didn’t elaborate on whether Roof said anything to police although he did say Roof was armed when he was arrested. It was unclear if the firearm was the same one from the church shooting.
