The joint charity appeal for victims of typhoon Haiyan in the Philippines has raised almost £40m since its launch, the organisers said on Monday.
The £39m given to the Disasters Emergency Committee since the start of the appeal on 12 November is likely to be an underestimate because some cash given directly to the 14 leading charities which make up the DEC remains to be added to the total.
The fund is also due to receive additional money raised by the Sun and donations connected to this weekend's X Factor shows, which contributed profits generated from phone-in votes.
The response comes amid a record £31m given to the BBC's annual Children in Need appeal, which was televised on Friday, and despite the DEC initially wondering whether to get involved.
The umbrella group only launches fundraising drives for major disasters and when it is confident the sums it is likely to raise will be significantly more than what member charities might collect alone.
While the first criterion was clearly met – more than 3,900 people are confirmed dead and 4 million displaced – the DEC wondered about the response for a country with few cultural or historic links with Britain.
This turned out to be misplaced, mirroring the response to an appeal in 2010 after the Haiti earthquake, which eventually raised £107m, said Brendan Paddy from the DEC.
"People in both cases have been absolutely, overwhelmingly generous to people, because they have seen the devastation to their lives. We've got people saying: 'I'm on incapacity benefits, my benefits are being cut, but I've got food on the table so I'm going to give some money. That's the kind of response we're getting from people," he said.
Similar tales are recounted on a DEC Facebook page where people can explain why they donated.
One woman writes: "My 11-year-old daughter donated her birthday money because: 'I would like new things but I don't need them, and others do.'"
A man said his family had decided to donate in lieu of giving each other Christmas presents.
Average donations were more than £50, but this included a lot of much smaller sums.
Paddy said : "You do get kids giving their pocket money, or saying: 'It's my birthday and I want to give my money to the people in the Philippines.'"
While the Philippines appeal has some way to go to match the sums raised for Haiti, or the £71m given for the devastating floods in 2010 in Pakistan or the appeal the next year for food aid in east Africa, it could well end up being bigger. A total of £23m was given in the first 48 hours for the Philippines, as against £15m for Haiti.
The sums are likely to be boosted by the extra publicity from the X Factor coverage at the weekend, and a telethon event on Monday evening, where people could phone in donations to celebrities including Alan Rickman, Jamie Oliver and Andrew Marr.
