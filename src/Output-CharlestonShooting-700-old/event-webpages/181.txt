JOHNSTON, Iowa – At an event Saturday, Republican candidate Ted Cruz spoke about the shooting that occurred in Charleston, South Carolina.
21-year-old Dylann Roof shot nine people to death at Charleston’s Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church on Wednesday in Charleston.
While in Johnston, Cruz discussed the shooting and said it was horrifying and the face of evil.
“We should be looking at this as an opportunity to bring people together and to pray for the families. One of the incredible things yesterday was to see the families of those who were murdered, calling for forgiveness for the murders. What a powerful demonstration of Christian love. I have to admit, if it were my family, I don’t think I could demonstrate that degree of forgiveness.”
