SLC police seek suspect in homicide, say he should be considered armed, dangerous


 


SALT LAKE CITY – Police are seeking a man they’ve identified as a suspect in an alleged murder that occurred in January, and while they ask anyone who sees him to call police they urge citizens not to approach the man—who they said should be considered armed and dangerous.
According to a press release from Salt Lake City Police Department, authorities are attempting to locate 36-year-old Eric Burwell.
Police stated the man is a suspect in a homicide case stemming from January 24, when a motorist found 24-year-old Christian McDonald lying alongside the street with a gunshot wound in the area of 1224 East Parkway Ave.
Burwell is described as being 5-feet 9-inches tall, and he weighs between 250 and 300 pounds. The man has black hair or possibly a shaved head and dark eyes.
Anyone with information about Burwell or who sees him is asked to contact the Salt Lake City Police Department at 801-799-3000. Tips can also be sent anonymously via text message by sending the keyword TIPSLCD and the relevant information to 274637. Tipsters in this incident should reference case #15-13711.
Two individuals were arrested in connection with the murder in February, click here for details on those arrests.
