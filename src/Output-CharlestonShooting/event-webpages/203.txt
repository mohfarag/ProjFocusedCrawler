CHICAGO (STMW)
 – A 20-year-old man was charged Friday in connection with the police-involved shooting late Thursday on the Northwest Side where police shot and killed a man who opened fire on them as they responded to a fatal shooting.


Miguel Ruiz, 20, of the 4600 block of North Central Park Avenue, was charged with one count of first degree murder and one count of felony murder, according to a release from police News Affairs.


About 10:30 p.m. Albany Park District tactical officers responded to a “shots fired” call in the area around the 4900 block North Troy Street and saw a vehicle fleeing that matched the description of one used in the shooting, according to a statement from police News Affairs.


The officers pursued the vehicle and were trying to pull it over when the male passenger got out in the 5300 block of North Kedzie Avenue and started shooting, the statement said. The officers returned fire and hit the shooter, killing him.


Alfredo Carranza, of an unidentified address, was dead on the scene after being shot by police at 5339 N. Kedzie Ave. at 2 a.m., according to the Cook County Medical Examiner’s office. He is described as in his 20s and an autopsy Friday determined he died of multiple gunshot wounds, according to the medical examiner’s office. His death was ruled a homicide.


Another man, 19, was shot in the head about 10:15 p.m in the 4900 block of Troy Street, police News Affairs Officer Hector Alfaro said.


The man was dead on the scene at 4915 N. Troy St., according to the medical examiner’s office. The man has been identified as Andre Ephrame, of the 6400 block of North Hamilton Avenue.


No officers were injured in the incident, according to the release. A gun was recovered.


The Independent Police Review Authority was notified of the police-involved shooting incident but did not have any other details, spokesman Eric Muellenbach said. He confirmed a weapon was recovered at the scene.


Fraternal Order of Police spokesman Pat Camden defended the police-involved shooting, saying the suspect opened fire at the uniformed officers after they pulled over the vehicle he was riding in at 5335 N. Kedzie Ave.


He said the vehicle involved was a dark-colored Chevrolet Suburban SUV wanted in connection to the shots fired call. A male suspect driving the SUV was taken into custody, he said.


Grand Central Area detectives and the IPRA are investigating.


Ruiz is scheduled to appear Saturday in bond court.
