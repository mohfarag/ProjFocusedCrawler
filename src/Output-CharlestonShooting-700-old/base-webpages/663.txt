Update- 11:29 pm EST: An official close to the investigation told CNN there have been multiple fatalities, while the Charleston police has not yet confirmed the deaths. And the individual above in handcuffs is not the suspect, as the Charleston PD is still tweeting they’re searching for the shooter:

— Charleston P.D. (@CharlestonPD) June 18, 2015

Update- 12:55 am EST: Nine people are now reported dead, one of them identified as South Carolina state senator Reverend Clementa Pinckney.
Governor Nikki Haley issued a brief statement:
Michael, Rena, Nalin and I are praying for the victims and families touched by tonight’s senseless tragedy at Emanuel AME Church. While we do not yet know all of the details, we do know that we’ll never understand what motivates anyone to enter one of our places of worship and take the life of another. Please join us in lifting up the victims and their families with our love and prayers.
Jeb Bush‘s campaign also sent his condolences in a statement, in which they also said they would be calling off Bush’s planned campaign stop in Charleston on Thursday.
There were also reports of a bomb threat in the area.
Update- 1:12 am EST: Police chief Greg Mullen said at a late night press conference that he does believe this was a hate crime, as the shooting occurred at a historically black church.
Update- 11:37 am EST: The suspect, Dylann Storm Roof, has been arrested in North Carolina.
