Neal Augenstein and Mike Murillo at the news conference about to begin regarding the case. I'm going to go ahead and send them some of your questions. by WTOP News 9/23/2014 10:55:47 PM

Has the person of interest or his family issued any statement whatsoever about his presumed innocence (until officially charged) or accounted for his actions on the night in question? by Mike 9/23/2014 10:56:45 PM  

Comment ()






His grandmother has said he's a good guy who would never hurt anyone. Mike Murillo and I tried  to reach Jesse Matthew through Fcebook, with no response.  by Neal Augenstein 9/23/2014 10:58:24 PM

The person of interest (POI) has indicated that they went their separate ways - was this just after they left the restaurant, and before the POI got into his car? by Don M. 9/23/2014 10:59:11 PM  

Comment ()






Apologies. We had technical issues, and there's been a major development by Neal Augenstein 9/23/2014 11:14:40 PM

Jesse Matthew has been charged with Abduction with Intent to Defile. Hannah Graham is still missing. by Neal Augenstein 9/23/2014 11:15:45 PM

Explain how the police evidently spoke withthe suspect on both Friday and Saturday and were unable to keep track of him - - understand how he eluded the police on Saturday after visiting the police station but exactly how does that happen given the charges just levied against him by RH 9/23/2014 11:16:58 PM  

Comment ()






Chief Tim Longo says the commonwealths attorney made the decision to charge this afternooN by Neal Augenstein 9/23/2014 11:17:23 PM  

Comment ()






On Saturday he was only charged with reckless driving so "manhunt" wouldn't be appropriate.  Police say they only have so many resources for a driving charge.  by Neal Augenstein 9/23/2014 11:19:11 PM  

Comment ()






Did they find something in the car or apartment that lead them to believe he was intent on hurting her? (weapons, bindings, duct tape...) by SW 9/23/2014 11:19:30 PM  

Comment ()






Chief Tim Longo didn't take questions tonight, except to answer the question of whether police were still searching for Hannah. His answer was yes, emphatically by Neal Augenstein 9/23/2014 11:20:56 PM  

Comment ()






Police have not discussed anything they found. With the charge of attempt to defile, it's clear police have recovered some evidence that would lead to that charge. by Neal Augenstein 9/23/2014 11:22:12 PM  

Comment ()






could you review the evidence that changed the charge from wreckless driving to abduction with intent to defile? by lawfreak1 9/23/2014 11:22:23 PM  

Comment ()






Thanks, LF1: police have not described any evidence they've found. Obviously, attempt to defile requires certain criminal acts. by Neal Augenstein 9/23/2014 11:24:02 PM  

Comment ()






Is it known who was in the car with Jesse when he sped away from poice station? by val 9/23/2014 11:24:26 PM  

Comment ()






Thanks, Val. Police tell me he drove away with his mother in the car. by Neal Augenstein 9/23/2014 11:25:00 PM  

Comment ()






I don't think its clear the forensics revealed anything; the fact that the police have video of Hannah Graham with a 32 year old guy touching her after her last text to friends and buying drinks for a juvenile is actually enough pc for an arrest warrant. by lawfreak1 9/23/2014 11:25:12 PM  

Comment ()






LF1: Interesting read. I'd imagine police and prosecutors have something a little more concrete than a touch.  by Neal Augenstein 9/23/2014 11:26:45 PM

What's the latest on the whereabouts of jesse matthews? by Emily 9/23/2014 11:26:55 PM  

Comment ()






Thanks Emily. Still no info on where Jesse Matthew is--at least that police are sharing. Chief has said he could be anywhere by Neal Augenstein 9/23/2014 11:28:06 PM  

Comment ()






What are the plans to continue searching for Hannah Graham or is it the assumption she is with Jessee Matthew? by Em 9/23/2014 11:29:10 PM  

Comment ()






Please describe the "official" and community attendees in the room... by CLC 9/23/2014 11:29:11 PM  

Comment ()






Did they say when the next time would be when they would give us more information? by Adler 9/23/2014 11:29:12 PM  

Comment ()






Em, while police have warned against tunnel vision, at this point they're only focusing on Jesse Matthew by Neal Augenstein 9/23/2014 11:30:42 PM  

Comment ()






CLC-- I'm not sure who was in the room. This was a hastily called news conference and to be honest, everyone (me included) was scrambling to get in place by Neal Augenstein 9/23/2014 11:31:46 PM  

Comment ()






Why isn't there a more logical approach towards monitoring, following or keeping track of suspects that are of strong interest in cases like this instead of allowing them time for an escape or risking loosing track of this person? Is it too costly or too difficult?  Citizens life's are monitored constantly without being of any interest or for any particular reason. Through technology it can be known who we called, what we said, where we ate or what we bought 2 minutes ago. Yet we can't put an "invisible fence" around a person of significant interest in a case where there is video evidence showing the missing young 18 year old victim stumbling down the street, intoxicated, last seen being followed, drinking and possibly driving off with that person of interest. by Monica from Culpeper, VA 9/23/2014 11:33:03 PM  

Comment ()






Adler-- it's not clear when more info will be forthcoming. I'm not clear on whether police received their forensics results from the state lab. It wasn't looking like they were going to get it late in the afternoon by Neal Augenstein 9/23/2014 11:34:11 PM  

Comment ()






Monica --good question. There are lots of technical ways to track and monitor. Virginia State Police and FBI were tailing JM, but at time he was only wanted on reckless driving so had limited resources. Police are saying they did the best they could, given circumstances.   by Neal Augenstein 9/23/2014 11:36:31 PM  

Comment ()






Are the investigators still questioning the older white male who they noticed had originally been following Hannah?  The Pizzeria video tape, where it showed that white male looking behind her, then stopping to let her pass and then falling in behind her did not show concern on his part, if you ask me.  I became suspicious...and wondered if he was in Cahoots with the black man with the dreads and long white shorts. by Brigid 9/23/2014 11:36:47 PM  

Comment ()






Hi, Brigid. Police aren't closing off possibilities, but Jesse Matthew is the focus. by Neal Augenstein 9/23/2014 11:38:11 PM  

Comment ()






Melanie asked on our live blog: We know Hannah's cell phone was on at the time of her disappearance. Have police indicated anything about tower pings to help narrow the search area? by WTOP News 9/23/2014 11:38:45 PM  

Comment ()






Good question, Melanie. Police are working with phone companies in tracking her movements. Her phone has not been recovered.  by Neal Augenstein 9/23/2014 11:40:03 PM  

Comment ()






Neal - the police have had "something a little more concrete than a touch" for a week: adult male with no know relationship to HG, follows her on video at 1 am and is taped putting his arms around her, taking her to a bar, buys drinks for her (misdemeanor), and is the last known person to see her alive, and has now disappeared himself. In DC, that's and arrest. I agree that the forensics probably put HG in Matthew's car. by lawfreak1 9/23/2014 11:40:12 PM

Law freak, when the charges come out, let's touch base to see how your theories panned out. Appreciate the input! by Neal Augenstein 9/23/2014 11:41:52 PM

How is defile defined in a legal sense? by val 9/23/2014 11:42:03 PM  

Comment ()






what obligation does the lawyer have to disclose information on the whereabouts of  JM by SB 9/23/2014 11:43:40 PM  

Comment ()






§ 18.2-48. Abduction with intent to extort money or for immoral purpose.Abduction (i) of any person with the intent to extort money or pecuniary benefit, (ii) of any person with intent to defile such person, (iii) of any child under sixteen years of age for the purpose of concubinage or prostitution, (iv) of any person for the purpose of prostitution, or (v) of any minor for the purpose of manufacturing child pornography shall be punishable as a Class 2 felony. If the sentence imposed for a violation of (ii), (iii), (iv), or (v) includes a term of confinement less than life imprisonment, the judge shall impose, in addition to any active sentence, a suspended sentence of no less than 40 years. This suspended sentence shall be suspended for the remainder of the defendant's life subject to revocation by the court. by WTOP News 9/23/2014 11:44:34 PM

To the best of my knowledge (as a reporter, not a lawyer, this is the Virginia code for the charge by Neal Augenstein 9/23/2014 11:45:50 PM  

Comment ()






SB-- I'm sure any lawyer would recommend him turning himself in, especially since there's a wanted poster and a "manhunt" by Neal Augenstein 9/23/2014 11:47:11 PM  

Comment ()






Are police investigating the possibility he could have used his knowledge of the UVa medical center to dispose of Hannah or evidence? by Phil 9/23/2014 11:47:34 PM  

Comment ()






Phil-- I don't think he had much medical training -- he transported people to surgery. That said, police are talking to Matthew's employer by Neal Augenstein 9/23/2014 11:49:20 PM  

Comment ()






Did any security cameras actually record Hannah and Matthew together anywhere? by Curt Krafft 9/23/2014 11:49:38 PM  

Comment ()






Curt -- besides them walking together on the mall? Police may have other surveillance videos they haven't shared. by Neal Augenstein 9/23/2014 11:51:13 PM  

Comment ()






Have the police given any additional information about the clothing removed from Matthew's apartment?  Was is clothing that Hanna was wearing or was it Matthew's clothing, or someone else's? by gwalum2004 9/23/2014 11:51:52 PM  

Comment ()






Gwalum -- unclear what clothing was recovered, and who it belonged to by Neal Augenstein 9/23/2014 11:53:33 PM  

Comment ()






Last question, police are asking me to leave this room by Neal Augenstein 9/23/2014 11:54:14 PM  

Comment ()






Is it just me or does this investigation seem to be going excrutiatingly slow?  Maybe, because there's so much information that we want it to coalesce a little faster?  Or, maybe the investigators are being extra careful not to screw anything up so that the perp can't get off the hook on some techincality?  The missing cell phone, especially, seems to really be going slower than it should..... by B 9/23/2014 11:54:20 PM

This is important. I just confirmed police received the forensics report, which led to the defile charge by Neal Augenstein 9/23/2014 11:55:57 PM  

Comment ()






B -- police cases are made and broken on evidence. They now have the forensics evidence, which led to the defile charge. Bottom line, police still need to find Hannah Graham by Neal Augenstein 9/23/2014 11:57:08 PM

We're wrapping up now. Thanks for participating everyone. Please check back to WTOP for as-they-happen updates on this story. by WTOP News 9/23/2014 11:57:50 PM
