CLEVELAND - A vigil will be held Thursday afternoon in support of a Cleveland area family who lost a relative in the Charleston AME church shooting.
Euclid resident Tim Jackson, 36, said his grandmother, Susie Jackson, 87, was killed when a man — believed to be 21-year-old Dylann Storm Roof — opened fire, killing six females and three males at a prayer meeting, at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, S.C.
“It's just hard to process that my grandmother had to leave Earth this way," said Jackson. "It's real real hard. It's challenging because I don't believe she deserved to go this way. It hurts to process.”
Susie Jackson was a longtime member of the church, and served in the choir and on the usher board. Tim Jackson said she was a very loving, giving person with a great smile.
 
 
 
“This is tragic because she's a very helpful person," said Jackson.
Susie Jackson's son Walter Jackson is on his way to Charleston Thursday, his son Tim Jackson told newsnet5.com's Kristin Volk.
Susie Jackson visited her family in Cleveland two weeks ago. 
“Just her being here about two weeks ago gave us a chance to see her smiling and laughing and saying hi to the grandkids," added Jackson.
The vigil, at St. James AME at 8401 Cedar Avenue, will be at 4:30 p.m. 
newsnet5.com's Kristin volk and Leon Bibb are following this news today and will provide updates on 
 NewsChannel 5 this afternoon.
NOTE: Originally newnet5.com reported that Susie Jackson was 98.
