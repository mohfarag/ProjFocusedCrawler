	The church is usually a retreat for solace, prayer, and reflection, but on Wednesday night, in Charleston, S.C., a cold-hearted killer made it a place to unleash his fury.



	The FBI is searching for a white man in his 20s, who sat through an hour of service at the Mother Emanuel AME Church, before 
killing six women and three men
, leaving behind a lone witness to spread his evil message.

They would have been especially angry, because the public description would not have included “black”!
That much said, this does look like some kind of hate crime – possibly outside the Fergtard box (anti-Christian, ISIS provocation, etc.) – but most likely some kind of racial hate crime.  If the races were reversed, the media would still be deciding if it was workplace violence, but at least here, people are being reasonable in their suspicions.

Has some official stated this was a hate crime?  If it turns out the shooter is a gat dude shooting up a church that is anti-homosexual, is it still a hate crime.  I mean, if the shooter is gay, and the victims are black, which protected class gets preference?  If the shooter is a homosexual, this will be as tough as nut to crack as the Dolezal scan.  How does the left reconcile this dichotomy between protected species?
If it’s a straight white guy, how do they know it was a hate crime?  If they don’t even have the right guy in custody, how do they know what his motive was?  Oh, he yelled racial epithets the surviving congregation will say so, I guess.  That will be the evidence just because the shooter is allegedly white.  But, what if he’s muslim?  Then what?

Kitty–So glad you asked! I’ve been working on this! Shortest answer possible here, for real! It is a Very Tricky Wheel of Oppression, very much in flux. (Plus I figure it’s okay to write a lot here now, since there are other, newer threads. So, I accidentally had a double espresso……….hence, this is for YOU!).
Now, in 2015:
 Black> Muslim> Gay.  [Double points for Black Muslims, & Black Lesbians, but not for Black Gay Males–no idea why, just observing. Prove me wrong! Now, Black Muslim Lesbian equals a Triple Threat, but Black Lesbian Muslim Single Mom?? Ding ding ding! We have a winner, & she’s probably offered a reality show, which will in no way affect her EBT, Section 8, etc. Okay, MAYBE they take the Obamaphone away–we gotta be fair, right?].
[Oh, almost forgot–if that same Black Lesbian Muslim Single Mom is tragically shot in a drive-by, putting her in a Wheelchair, and she then develops OCD from all the stress? The Deciders’ heads explode w/ fully unrecognized Joy that they falsely claim to be “Empathy”, and they immediately build her a Castle with Washer/ Dryer; Indoor Therapy Pool, Allah-Footbaths, and Hardwood Floors she is now unable to clean by herself.  So an Obama-Approved, hardworking Illegal Alien Latina Maid will be happily hired on indefinitely–do not refer to her as a Maid though, nor ever mention how America is the Land of Opportunity, that is hurtful!].
{Should our Black Lesbian Physically-Challenged Muslim Single Mom happen to fall in love w/ Obama-Approved Illegal Alien Latina, our Dear Leaders will be overcome w/ genuine rapture, and they will offer to pay for a Kardashian-Level Same-Sex-Wedding, provided they may tape it for NBC, and rerun it every Christmas. For Easter, they can film the beautiful journey of LezMuz and Illegia as they seek to become well-paid foster parents for Illegia’s plucky little Unaccompanied Guatemalan Fake-Cousins, and everyone is brave, noble, & Leaning-In because Everyone Knows that They Are On the RIGHT Side of History!}.
[Did I mention that said Castle is next door to Little Ol’ White Privileged YOU, and it turns out some of the plucky little Unaccompanied Children are strapping young males, w/ self-inflicted “Brown Pride”, “Viva Aztlan!” tattoos, who wear Che and oddly incongruous Malcolm X  tee shirts–and they all really, REALLY like your car! Enjoy your newly-mandated Oppression Experience, your Great-Grandfather probably said the N-word once or twice, so Welcome to Your Permanent Teachable Moment!].   :D

Megyn Kelly had the poor woman who was almost beheaded in Oklahoma on today. You know, the one w/ the black Muslim beheader (who did manage to successfully thoroughly decapitate her co-worker, but was stopped halfway through slicing this woman when the company’s CEO shot him)?  The one where he said he “hates white people” shortly pre-slice, when cooler heads still prevailed…….and were still attached? That one?
Not a hate crime.
Guess the race of both victims. Things are truly seeming sinister now–we passed “completely unfair”, & “incredibly hypocritical” way back when Holder deemed the SINGLE example of ONE white guy playing the Knock-Out Game a hate crime, which it absolutely WAS, but neglected to even acknowledge the roving packs of vibrant youths who have been happily playing it for at least the past three years.
I guess it’s all part of The Plan–the one that I used to consider just your standard Crazy Homeless Person Rant, right up there w/ All-Pigeons-Are-Really-Robotic-Govt-Microphones, & Cops-Are-Sewer-Dwelling-Alligators-In-Disguise.
But the hypocrisy is now palpable. And instant! How the HELL do the lo-fo’s, of ALL races, not see it? Or how the eff do they not CARE, no matter HOW fun gibsmedats and lofty self-righteousness apparently must be??   White MSM talking heads who have kids know their kids are white, don’t they? There are never gonna be enough gated communities w/ fences high enough to keep out all the hatred they are growing in everyone from innocent first-graders to the very last black members of the Greatest Generation. They truly want them to believe that Evil White Cops pretty much ONLY even took the job because they salivate at the mere idea of hurting & killing “black bodies”.
The hate they have stirred will spill over, and continue coagulating with the Islamic contingency, even if our side has completely valid & vetted examples that THOSE energetic sweethearts are rabid anti-black racists, who are chomping at the bit to remedy any unfair “Hatred Inequality” as soon as the time is right. I’m quite sure that throwing blacks, or women, off of buildings is just as enjoyable & satisfying as flinging a f__got; it must be great fun to mimic the various different screams and pleas.
Sorry so lengthy–it’s hard not to go totally off-kilter-gonzo when the whole World is.
And  later today, all the Prog-Bloggers will write how horrible Right-Wing ones are. But
they’re not gonna explain WHY.
Still, prayers. Prayers, prayers, prayers! This is not who we are supposed to be.

So true, Moishe. What is ironic about your comment is that the people killed were in a Bible study class. Based on the photo of the AME minister, this is the cream of the crop of Charleston citizens. Middle class and up.
Also ironic is the sign in front of the AME church, noting that congregants were “slaves and free blacks” who founded and built the church. So, I’m guessing that the cream of Charleston goes WAY back in history.
And finally, I’m guessing that the shooter, if rumors are correct and he worked at the church, he may have been a janitor.

First, he didn’t resist.  He went peaceably.  They should try it.  Also, since he’s the wrong guy, he probably has the intellectual wherewithal to understand it’ll be cleared up and no charges are better than resisting or assaulting or obstruction charges.  Some ethnicities are less prone to react emotionally, live in the moment and seek instant gratification.

I don’t want in any way to detract from the horrendous nature of this crime.
However, “police say” in this case means that “the media says that a person who is somehow connected to the police told them that someone who claimed to be a witness said it was a white male.”
In other words, we should assume nothing.

Whatever in hell made him think the racial issues are over?  Or, are they only over when blacks aren’t feeling frisky?
Blacks have been starting crap all over the country, mainly with the police but there’s been an awful lot of collateral damage to other ethnicities, mainly white.  I don’t think it’s over just because Charleston’s kittle BGI faction is taking a break.  Did the guy who said this not know about McKinney or what happened earlier today at an OH pool?

It is truly awful this has happened. My prayers to the families. Obviously, their grief–and the FEAR that the community must be experiencing is very, very real.
I don’t know if it’s okay to speak out honestly, or if the sentiments from an earlier, more civil and polite society ought to prevail–and I say this b/c NOT letting people speak w/ raw honesty, & worse, encouraging DISHONESTY, is so obviously NOT working, and we’re way past crisis at this point. Is it kinder to shut up for politeness’ sake? Or will nothing change until an honest dialogue starts (not that famed ideological “Conversation”. Needs to be a two-way dialogue. Sometimes it might be better to just say what’s in one’s head, because at least having a screaming fight gets all things out on the table, even & ESPECIALLY at a sensitive time. Those they may be seeking to “protect”, are in truth not being protected at all).
So I’ll try to keep it to this: If a black man opened fire in a white church, killing nine people, I doubt that MSNBC would be cancelling scheduled shows to interview the stricken community, and calling it a Hate Crime. If they indeed DID choose to cover it w/ no commercials, they would be calling Anti-Gun Activists to weigh in w/ their opinions. It WOULD BE TREATED DIFFERENTLY.
Wasn’t there a shooting of six people at a playground in Chicago a few months ago? Did that black-on-black horrendous crime get the 24/7 treatment?  It could be b/c they knew who that perp was, or something similar, but I just hate that now I’ve been conditioned to think racially. I know who to not thank for that.
Still, prayers for the innocent people–they should not have to live in fear. I do not think all this is helping to reassure them.
Kind of the point, no?

Only if it were a supposed white shooter in a white church. But then he wouldn’t need to now, would he?
I get so damn mad about the poor people in the community who DON’T subscribe to that mess, like the elderly, who know what REAL racism and police brutality is! I can shoot my  (white) mouth off all day long about what I “think” I would so bravely do if I had to live there. But I don’t (so far–Zero’s working on that). I’m too much of a coward now to even ask certain individuals to please not speak during a movie! Learned that lesson courtesy of a few angry Latinas. So there I go, treating some people differently–even if it’s out of fear & past experience, it’s still technically racist. Practical, but racist. But the WORST racism I have ever seen comes from blacks against blacks who won’t kowtow to their bullcrap. There was an older black man tonight, had to be at least 80 or older, who looked right into the camera, and he looked so sad & lost, my heart broke. Did anyone rush to interview HIM? No, too busy w/ the squeaky, squeaky wheels, like his Master, the Great-Snitching-Rights-Decider in the daishiki & the reggae hat. These battles are generational, as well as racial.

That’s not what a “hate crime” is.  But I bet you know that.  It’s only a hate crime if it’s directed at certain people whom certain other people are not allowed to hate.  So if it turns out the shooter was black…no hate crime.  If the shooter was “transgendered” … no hate crime.  Only straight, white people can “hate” the way it needs to be done for a “hate crime.”

If it turns out it really was a white guy who did this, Sharpton and others of his ilk will LOVE that this tragedy happened! I’m not joking in the least, I 100% believe it…. he and they are just. that. vile.

If he turns out to be a ‘white hispanic’  the media will implode.
If he turns out to be a muslim convert in the ‘sudden jihad’ zone, we will have to suffer another ‘cleansing’ by the head booger picker/moron in charge.
Sharpton’s sure to ‘much’ it up and work the crowd for more money to withold from the IRS either way.

Yes. Thanks for reminding us, Al, and heading right on down there.  What a coincidence that Hilary spoke to the Scott family just today after basically no attention for months.  Then a very young white guy shoots up the oldest AME church in America and just happens to kill a State Sen, who just happens to have led Scott’s prayer vigil, and then Sharpton tweets out the connection and heads to town immediately for some “peaceful protests”.ah’yah.

No cell phone video.
No  surveillance video/CCTV.
White male in a black neighborhood with documented violence at 9 PM (in a town where a white police officer has been charged with murder of a black suspect).
FBI claimed to be on scene within minutes.
Eleven people reportedly in a prayer meeting (number to possibly include shooter). Nine are dead. If shooter is #10, then by the math description is from one person.
If shooter is not one of the eleven, then possible corroboration from two survivors (and possibly another deceased later at the hospital).
Lots of reasons to wonder about the veracity of the information thus far.

My rant: I hate to bring this up, but wasn’t the shooter a white person and do you think maybe this is a white man that has been pushed too far, as crazy as it may be to most of us is this what we have to look forward to is this craziness on both sides of the colour line. Blacks crying racism and acting up and whites going ballistic with mass shootings. A person can only be pushed into a corner for so long before they strike back, just like the guy in Dallas. In one way I feel for him from what his dad said he felt there was nothing left to his life. With his taken away and broke from spending all his money on attorney fees and god knows what else the government and his Ex-wife squeezed him for. And on top of that his ability to work was taken from him with a misdemeanour conviction of domestic violence, hell I have one of those for throwing a brick through my ex-husbands back door because he stole my keys and I couldn’t get into the house, and I got a domestic violence charge because he happened to be in the house when I through the brick. I did not know he was in there but the courts don’t care. Public defenders and judges all have quotas to meet or they don’t get re-elected or get paid. This system is broken and the only way to fix it is total annihilation and to begin a new from the embers will rise a true leader, because what we have now is just a puppet who was put into office to start a race was. It was obvious from the beginning. Come on we were not ready for a black president but he was forced on us at the perfect timing. Think about it a half-breed half white half black. He spoke for everyone even the mexicans because he looked black and black is a minority. Even though he has white, he looks black and so the Negroes think he is one of them but he is not. Obama grew up privileged and not white privilege either, but RICH, WEALTHY PRIVILEGE! There is only two veins that run through this American body RICH and POOR, and don’t you forget about it and deny it or be fooled into thinking you have any say because you don’t. Observe to what is happening and then tell me you have any power, ah ha ha.

There are people in the black community who are basically being held hostage–I’d venture there are probably more of them afraid to speak out than there are “moderate Muslims”.
It is SO hard not to get angry–I feel like I hate people for making me realize I can hate so strongly. But even if the above theory would be proven wrong, what the hell would be able to be done about it? We can’t even get illegal alien MURDERERS deported, so clearly, we have to be able to live w/ each other. I think we were at least doing that a LOT better P.P.P.—that’s Pre-Peace Prize, weren’t we? And what’s the alternative?
When you feel like you might choke on your anger & frustration, may I suggest to try quietly chanting to yourself “Not ALL, only SOME. Not ALL, only SOME”………?
The good part is you can use it for all KINDS of different groups–even fellow conservatives who grate easily. Hang in there! It likely won’t help you, or anyone else if you throw any bricks–real ones, or metaphorical!

This is a sad event.  That sadness goes beyond race or belief.
While politicians, the media, and community leaders generate unnecessary conflict by stirring up the the black community with manufactured anger and hate over false racism and injustice, an unintended consequence is the lack of empathy of other races with blacks.
A consequence of that growing lack of empathy is that a small percentage of troubled or mentally unstable whites may feed off this emotion and seek retribution for the (mostly excused) violence of blacks.
This, in turn further angers the black community and is used as justification for further anti-social action.
After considering this, I am so distrustful of the black community and the media that, despite these reports, I could completely believe the shooter was not white.  I could believe this to be a rumor, or intentional false victimization, that everyone immediately ran with simply because it fit the popular narrative.
Hopefully they catch the shooter and this is resolved quickly,

I guess they are “fired up” now. It seems Obama and Clinton considered SC key to securing the black vote.
Are black voters ‘fired up’ for Hillary Clinton?
Edith Childs is the Greenwood, S.C. city council woman credited with giving Barack Obama his signature call-and-response chant used during his historic 2008 presidential campaign.
The question facing Hillary Clinton’s campaign eight years later — one whose answer may define the margin between success and failure: are Childs, and voters like her, now “Fired up! Ready to go!” for Obama’s primary opponent in 2016?

“On a campaign stop in the city Wednesday, Clinton spoke passionately about police violence, calling Scott’s death a “terrible tragedy.” She left the city before the shooting occurred, a campaign aide confirmed.
Pastor Pinckney returned after the event to the AME church, where Bible study was underway Wednesday around 9:00 p.m. local time when the shooting occurred.”

Just a thought: Ramadan started at sundown on June 17th. Islam’s aim is to start a race war in the U.S. to bring us to our knees. Maybe this was a Muslim extremist convert.
Even if this turns out to be the case the BLM crowd will still blame it on white racist’s in America.
Either way, it’s going to be a long, hot summer.

If true, it indicates that the gunman saw value in the propaganda, whether the reaction would be properly directed or not.  If false, then they need to get this witness (a) protected and (b) polygraphed.
A single witness is disturbing – particularly in this age of so many lies for “the cause”.

It has all the makings for a conspiracy theory.  Consider: Most high profile hate crime just happens when..  Top headline news is about a white girl who infiltrated blackness and making race baiters and liberals look like clowns.   Certainly a change in conversation was needed.  The timing could not be more convenient.

I haven’t seen it mentioned in this thread but the AME Church (collectively) is anti-gay.
……………………………………………………………………………………………………………………..
“The African Methodist Episcopal Church rejects the ordination of openly gay persons to the ranks of the clergy in the Church.[4] In a historic decision, which marked the first vote on the issue of marriage rights for same-sex couples by a predominantly African-American denomination, the African Methodist Episcopal Church unanimously voted to forbid ministers from blessing same-sex unions in July 2004.[4][5] The church leaders stated that homosexual activity “clearly contradicts [their] understanding of Scripture.”[4]”
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homosexuality_and_Methodism

The media reports certainly are not going to remind anyone of that or it being a possible motive.

That does not make a lick of sense.  Maybe he ran out of ammo?  There is a room full of dead people shot.  What else could remain to be told?  That a white 21 yr old did it?  Only a person who wants to get caught would do that.

There may not being any footage of the ambulances due to the load and go nature of the shooting. When it comes to serious life threatening trauma a lot of paramedics would just load the patient and rush to the nearest trauma center for surgery.  They will do what they can en route.
Basically the ambulances were gone before the media showed up.

Those are flags of Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe) and apartheid-era South Africa on his jacket. Both countries in Africa where a white European minority once dominated and ran things productively, now whites there are massacred non-stop and their property taken.
The AME church has been, politically and in terms of organizing protests, behind all the Trayvon, Mike Brown, and McKinney stuff all along. This kid knew exactly what he wanted to do and why.
